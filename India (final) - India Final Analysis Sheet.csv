Aggressive behavior may be a mental health concern for young teens and is defined as a behavioral and emotional trait that may be distressing for others. This study aimed to understand the factors associated with aggressiveness among young teenage girls. A cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of 707 female middle school-aged students using multistage random sampling in Tabriz, Iran. The variables of interest were aggressiveness, general health status, happiness, social acceptance, and feelings of loneliness. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. Low parental support, low satisfaction with body image, high sense of loneliness, and lower perceived social acceptance were found to be the factors influencing aggressiveness. The current study found that the school environment, home environment, individual and interpersonal factors all play a part in aggressiveness. As a result, the contributing elements must be considered when creating and executing successful interventions to improve this population’s psychological well-being. © 2021 by the authors.

"Radwan E., Radwan A., Radwan W., Pandey D.","Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study among Palestinian students (10–18 years)",2021,BMC Psychology,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic considers a threat to students’ well-being and mental health. The current descriptive cross-sectional study aims to identify psychological distress among school students during the lockdown period. Methods: This study was carried out in a sample of 420 primary and secondary school students from June 10 to July 13, 2020, in the Gaza Strip in Palestine. Data was collected using an online questionnaire that included informed consent, socio-demographic questions, and a psychometric scale (DASS-21). Results: The results revealed that most students experienced moderate to severe levels of anxiety (89.1%) and depression (72.1%), whereas less than half of them (35.7%) experienced moderate to severe stress. Stress, anxiety and depression scores were significantly different across gender, age groups, family size, and family's economic status. The results showed that gender (β = -0.174, p < 0.001), age (β = −0.155, p = 0.001) and economic level of family (β = −0.147, p = 0.002) were negative predictors correlated with stress. Family size (β = 0.156, p = 0.001) played a positive role in stress. It was found that gender (β = −0.105, p = 0.031), age (β = −0.135, p = 0.006) and economic level of family (β = −0.136, p = 0.005) were negative predictors correlated with anxiety, whereas family size (β = 0.139, p = 0.004) played a positive role in anxiety. For depression, gender (β = −0.162, p = 0.001), age (β = −0.160, p = 0.001) and economic level of family (β = −0.131, p = 0.007) were negative predictors correlated with depression, whereas family size (β = −0.133, p = 0.006) was found to be a positive predictor. Concerns about the influence of COVID-19 on economic, education, and daily life were positively correlated to the levels of depression, anxiety and stress, whereas the availability of social support was negatively correlated. Conclusion: The development of a health protocol for influenced students is urgently needed to maintain them remain resilient during dangerous times. © 2021, The Author(s).",Anxiety; COVID-19; DASS-21 scale; Depression; Gaza Strip; Palestine; Stress,"Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Islamic University of Gaza, Gaza Strip, Palestine; Directorate of Education-East Gaza, Ministry of Education and Higher Education, Gaza Strip, Palestine; Faculty of Education, Islamic University of Gaza, Gaza Strip, Palestine; Faculty of Education, Ummah Open University, Gaza Strip, Palestine; Department of Technical Education, Dr. A.P.J.

"Sharratt K., Panicker A., Banerjee R., Mason S.J., Jones A., Varma B., Patil P., Wager N.",Profiles of abuse and neglect and the association with mental health indicators among a large sample of boys and girls from India,2021,Child Abuse and Neglect,"Background: Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a major public health concern, but limited data are available on the occurrence, co-occurrence, and correlates of these phenomena outside Western societies. Objectives: The first aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of CAN across two settings (inside and outside the home) among children and adolescents in Mumbai, India. Another aim was to use latent class analysis (LCA) to identify meaningful profiles of maltreatment, and to examine how class membership is associated with mental wellbeing. Participants and setting: Self-report data was collected from males (n = 4454; M age = 12.77 years) and females (n = 3850; M age = 12.87) at secondary schools. Results: Four latent classes of maltreatment were identified among males, including ‘low victimisation’ (50.4% of participants), ‘intra-familial non-sexual abuse’ (34.6%), ‘intra- and extra- familial non-sexual abuse’ (10.2%), and ‘poly-victimisation’ (4.8%). Among females, three latent classes were identified including, ‘low victimisation’ (68.1%), ‘intra-familial non-sexual abuse’ (28.8%), and ‘poly-victimisation’ (3.0%). Compared to the ‘low victimisation’ class, children in the abuse classes demonstrated higher levels of anxiety and depression and increased odds of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours. These associations were augmented for girls relative to boys. Conclusion: There were very few maltreated children who were subjected to just one form of CAN and experiencing co-occurring patterns of abuse and neglect was associated with indicators of poor mental health, especially among girls. These findings highlight the complexity of the situation and will inform policy makers, health professionals and school counsellors. © 2021",Anxiety; Child abuse and neglect (CAN); Depression; Latent class analysis (LCA); Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); Suicide,"University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield, United Kingdom; Idealists Consulting, Mumbai, India",English
"Malik K., Ibrahim M., Bernstein A., Venkatesh R.K., Rai T., Chorpita B., Patel V.",Behavioral Activation as an ‘active ingredient’ of interventions addressing depression and anxiety among young people: a systematic review and evidence synthesis,2021,BMC Psychology,"Background: Psychological interventions such as behavioral activation (BA) that focus on overt behaviors rather than complex cognitive skills may be developmentally well-suited to address youth mental health problems. The current systematic review synthesized evidence on the characteristics, effectiveness and acceptability of behavioral activation (BA) to examine its role as a potential ‘active ingredient’ for alleviating depression and anxiety among young people aged 14 to 24 years. Methods: Evidence across the following sources were synthesized: (i) randomized control trials (RCT) evaluating interventions where BA has been used as a standalone intervention or as part of a multicomponent intervention, (ii) qualitative studies examining the acceptability of BA as an intervention or as a coping strategy among young people with lived experiences. Consultations with a youth advisory group (YAG) from India were used to draw inferences from existing evidence and identify future research priorities. Results: As part of the review, 23 RCTs were identified; three studies examined BA as a standalone intervention, and the remaining studies examined multicomponent intervention where BA was a constituent element. The intervention protocols varied in composition, with the number of intervention elements ranging between 5 to 18. There was promising but limited evidence in standalone interventions for thse effectiveness of BA for depression. The impact of BA in multicomponent interventions was difficult to evaluate in the absence of focal assessment of activation outcomes. Evidence from 37 additional qualitative studies of youth lived experience literature, corroborated by the YAG inputs, indicated that young people preferred using behavioral strategies similar to BA to cope with depression in their own life. Themes indicated that the activities that are important to an individual and their socio-contextual factors need to be considered in the planning and implementing BA intervention. Evidence for the use of BA in anxiety was limited across data sources. Conclusions: Overall, there was preliminary empirical evidence for the effectiveness and acceptability of BA for youth depression. Further research is needed to examine the components and mechanisms that contribute to its effectiveness as an active intervention ingredient for depression and anxiety. © 2021, The Author(s).",Active ingredient; Behavioral activation; Lived experience; Systematic review; Transdiagnostic; Youth mental health,"Sangath, New Delhi, India; Jindal School of Psychology and Counselling, O.P.

Accuracy of clinicians’ diagnostic judgments applying draft ICD-11 as compared to the ICD-10 guidelines to standardized case vignettes was assessed as well as perceived clinical utility. Methods: 1357 clinician members of the World Health Organization's Global Clinical Practice Network completed the study in English, Spanish, Japanese or Russian. Participants were randomly assigned to apply ICD-11 or ICD-10 guidelines to one of eleven pairs of case vignettes. Results: Clinicians using the ICD-11 and ICD-10 guidelines achieved similar levels of accuracy in diagnosing mood disorders depicted in vignettes. Those using the ICD-11 were more accurate in identifying depressive episode in recurrent depressive disorder. There were no statistically significant differences detected across classifications in the accuracy of identifying dysthymic or cyclothymic disorder. Circumscribed problems with the proposed ICD-11 guidelines were identified including difficulties differentiating bipolar type I from bipolar type II disorder and applying revised severity ratings to depressive episodes. Clinical utility of ICD-11 bipolar disorders was found to be significantly lower than for ICD-10 equivalent categories. Limitations: Standardized case vignettes were manipulated to evaluate specific changes. The degree of accuracy of clinicians’ diagnostic judgments may not reflect clinical decision-making with patients. Conclusions: Alignment of the ICD-11 with current research appears to have been achieved without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy or clinical utility though specific training may be necessary as ICD-11 is implemented worldwide. Areas in which the ICD-11 guidelines did not perform as intended resulted in further revisions. © 2021",Classification; Diagnosis; ICD-10; ICD-11; International Classification of Diseases (ICD); Mood disorders,"School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, 136 Jean-Jacques Lussier Pvt., Vanier Building, Ottawa, Ontario  K1N 6N5, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, University of Campania “L.

"Verma A., Jain A., Srinivasan N.",Yes! I love my mother as much as myself: Self- and mother-association effects in an Indian sample,2021,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,"Information associated with the self is preferentially processed compared to information associated with others. However, cultural differences appear to exist in the way information is processed about those close to us like our mothers. In Eastern compared with Western cultures, information about the mother seems to be processed as well as our self. However, it is not clear whether this lack of difference is due to familiarity or would extend to processing arbitrary perceptual information associated with different categorical labels. The current study employs a perceptual association paradigm in which category labels like self, mother, and none are associated with arbitrary shapes to study self versus mother processing in an Indian sample. We hypothesised that there would be no difference between self and mother processing given the familial and collectivistic tendencies in India. Participants in two experiments performed a matching task between a shape and a pre-assigned category label, with self, mother, and none as categories in Experiment 1A and self, friend, and none as categories in Experiment 1B. As expected, analysis of response times (RT), accuracies, and signal detection theoretic measures showed that information about mother is processed as well as self in Experiment 1A, but this effect is not present with friend in Experiment 1B. Moreover, participants’ processing for the self-associated information gets attenuated depending upon the other close person category used in the task (friend vs. mother) indicating that self-information processing is dynamically dependent on the categorical contexts in which such processing takes place. Our findings have implications for understanding the processing of self-associated information across cultures and contexts. © Experimental Psychology Society 2021.",cultural variation; mother-reference; perceptual matching; Self-reference; social salience,"Department of Cognitive Science, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India",English
"Allen J.G., Romate J., Rajkumar E.",Mindfulness-based positive psychology interventions: a systematic review,2021,BMC Psychology,"Background: There are hundreds of mindfulness-based interventions in the form of structured and unstructured therapies, trainings, and meditation programs, mostly utilized in a clinical rather than a well-being perspective. The number of empirical studies on positive potentials of mindfulness is comparatively less, and their known status in academia is ambiguous. Hence, the current paper aimed to review the studies where mindfulness-based interventions had integrated positive psychology variables, in order to produce positive functioning. Methods: Data were obtained from the databases of PubMed, Scopus, and PsycNet and manual search in Google Scholar. From the 3831 articles, irrelevant or inaccessible studies were eliminated, reducing the number of final articles chosen for review to 21. Interventions that contribute to enhancement of eudaimonia, hedonia, and other positive variables are discussed. Results: Findings include the potential positive qualities of MBIs in producing specific positive outcomes within limited circumstances, and ascendancy of hedonia and other positive variables over eudaimonic enhancement. Conclusion: In conclusion, exigency of modifications in the existing MBIs to bring about exclusively positive outcomes was identified, and observed the necessity of novel interventions for eudaimonic enhancement and elevation of hedonia in a comprehensive manner. © 2021, The Author(s).",Eudaimonia; Hedonia; MBI; Mindfulness; Well-being,"Department of Psychology, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Central University of Karnataka, Kalaburagi, India",English
"Kaur S., Mir R.N., Khamparia A., Rani P., Gupta D., Khanna A.",Heterogeneous load balancing clustering protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,2021,Cognitive Systems Research,"Wireless Sensor Networks is one of the most significant area of research where large number of sensor nodes that are distributed in a geographical area operate on limited battery power. As these networks, depending on the application, are sometimes deployed in in-hostile environment, which makes energy conservation one of the major challenge faced in WSN. To reduce energy consumption, clustering is considered to be the most efficient technique. This work proposes a new clustering approach that decreases energy consumption and results in prolonged network lifetime which is an important requirement for networks operating in inaccessible areas. In the proposed approach, heterogeneity is also implemented to increase the stability and energy efficiency of random networks. We have evaluated the efficiency of the proposed protocol through simulations and comparison is performed with well-known existing distributed protocols. Proposed approach shows efficient results in terms of the stability period for different network configurations and Base Station positions. Also, the results are found better in terms of number of alive nodes and network lifetime. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Clustering; Heterogeneity; Probabilistic clustering; Wireless Sensor Networks,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India; National Institute of Technology, Srinagar, India; Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Satellite Centre, Tikarmafi, Amethi, India; Division of Computer Engineering, Netaji Subash University of Technology, New Delhi, India; Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India",English
"Patidar P., Mathur A., Pathak A.",Can use of pictograms reduce liquid medication administration errors by mothers? An interventional study,2021,BMC Psychology,"Background: Liquid medication dosing errors (LMDE) made by caregivers affect treatment in children, but this is not a well-studied topic in many low-and middle-income countries including in India. Methods: An intervention study was conducted among mothers attending a pediatric outpatient clinic of a tertiary care setting in Ujjain, India. The mothers randomly measured 12 volumes of a paracetamol liquid preparation by using a dropper (0.5 and 1 mL), measuring cup (2.5 and 5 mL), and calibrated spoon (2.5 and 5 mL) each with two instructions—oral-only measurement session (OMS) and oral plus pictogram measurement session (OPMS, the intervention). The main outcome was dosing error prevalence. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed by measuring effect size. Risk factors for maximum LMDE were explored using backward multivariate logistic regression models. A P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In total, 310 mothers [mean (± SD) age, 30.2 (± 4.18) years] were included. LMDE prevalence in the OMS versus OPMS for dropper 0.5 mL was 60% versus 48%; for l mL dropper was 63% versus 54%; for 2.5 mL cup 62% versus 54%; for 2.5 calibrated spoon 66% versus 59%; 5 mL cup 69% versus 57%; and 5 mL calibrated spoon 68% versus 55%. Comparing OMS with OPMS, underdosing was minimum with the calibrated spoon for 2.5 mL (OR 4.39) and maximum with the dropper for 1 mL (OR 9.40), and overdosing was minimum with the dropper for 0.5 mL (OR 7.12) and maximum with the calibrated spoon for 2.5 mL (OR 13.24). The effect size (dCohen) of the intervention OPMS was 1.86–6.4. Risk factors for the most prevalent dosing error, that is, with the calibrated spoon for 2.5 mL, were increasing age of the mother (aOR 1.08; P = 0.026) and nuclear family (aOR 2.83; P = 0.002).

Methods: Data from 700 mothers from the PRAMMS cohort (Prospective Assessment of Maternal Mental Health Study) were used. Pregnant women were assessed in each trimester—T1, T2 and T3, for symptoms of anxiety, and depression as well as partner violence. Multivariate analyses were performed for the whole sample and then for male and female infants separately. The final multivariable logistic regression models were each built using a backward selection procedure and controlling for confounders. To accommodate longitudinally measured data, change in scores (T2–T1 and T3–T2) of anxiety and depression were included in the model. Results: Of the 583 women with a singleton live birth, birth weight was available for 514 infants and LBW was recorded in 80 infants (15.6%). Of these, 23 infants were preterm.

"Muhammad T., Srivastava S., Sekher T.V.",Association of self-perceived income status with psychological distress and subjective well-being: a cross-sectional study among older adults in India,2021,BMC Psychology,"Background: As the older population aged 65 and over worldwide, is estimated to increase from 9% in 2019 to 16% in 2050, rapid aging will transform the aspects such as economic security, employment status, and family structure. The effects of lower levels of perceived income and poor socioeconomic status on the mental health of older adults appear to be large and enduring. Therefore, the present study contributes to the literature on understanding the association of socioeconomic conditions and self-perceived income status in particular, with self-assessed mental health outcomes (psychological distress and subjective well-being) among older adults in India. Methods: Data for the present study was derived from the Building Knowledge Base on Population Ageing (BKPAI) in India. Bivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to understand the relationship between socioeconomic status and outcome variables. Results: About 43% of older adults had no income whereas 7% had income but perceived as not sufficient to fulfil their basic needs. Nearly, 9% of older adults were retired from regular employment. Almost 70% older adults had received no pension and nearly 18% of older adults had no asset ownership. It is revealed that older adults with income that is partially sufficient to fulfil their basic needs were 2.23 times [OR: 2.23, CI: 1.75–2.84] and 1.96 times [OR: 1.96, CI: 1.55–2.47] significantly more likely to suffer from psychological distress and low subjective well-being than those who had income which was sufficient to fulfil their basic needs. Conclusions: By focusing on four target areas such as the income support, education, family oriented initiatives and local or regional policies, the current framework for assessing the mental health among older adults in India can be modified. A move towards a guaranteed pension for eligible older individuals by which they do not have to remain as a financial burden on their children, may reduce their self-perceived economic distress and result in higher levels of wellbeing in older ages. Also, strategies to address socioeconomic disadvantages and gender differentials related to mental health status among older population are urgently needed. © 2021, The Author(s).",India; Older adults; Psychological distress; Self-perceived income; Subjective well-being,"Department of Population Policies and Programs, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra  400088, India; Department of Mathematical Demography & Statistics, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra  400088, India",English

Participants in this classroom-based intervention were 121 students from grades 7 and 8 (Age = 11–13 years, M = 11.22 years, SD = 1.61, 53% male) from two schools in the National Capital Region of India. Using quasi-experimental design, participating classrooms in each school were randomized into intervention or control conditions. Intervention group engaged in 24 sessions—one corresponding to each character strength, spread over 12 weeks. All participants completed a questionnaire comprising measures of well-being, life satisfaction, happiness, affect, and self-esteem at pre- and post-test. Participants reported significant gains in happiness, life satisfaction, and positive affect at post-test. Findings suggest promising evidence for character strength interventions among Indian students, while also contributing to research evidence about cross-cultural relevance and validity of an existing intervention.

Jerrentrup M.T.,A Liberating Experience. On Becoming a Work of Art,2021,Creativity,"The art of bodypainting that is fairly unknown to a wider public turns the body into a canvas - it is a frequently used phrase in the field of bodypainting that illustrates the challenge it faces: it uses a three-dimensional surface and has to cope with its irregularities, but also with the model's abilities and characteristics. This paper looks at individuals who are turned into art by bodypainting. Although body painting can be very challenging for them - they have to expose their bodies and to stand still for a long time while getting transformed - models report that they enjoy both the process and the result, even if they are not confident about their own bodies. Among the reasons there are physical aspects like the sensual enjoyment, but also the feeling of being part of something artistic. This is enhanced and preserved through double staging - becoming a threedimentional work of art and then being staged for photography or film clips. This process gives the model the chance to experience their own body in a detached way. On the one hand, bodypainting closely relates to the body and on the other hand, it can help to over-come the body. © 2020 Maja Tabea Jerrentrup, published by Sciendo 2020.",Body painting; Identity; Model; Participant Observation; Well-Being,"Ajeenkya Dy Patil University, Pune, Maharashtra  412105, India",English
Jha S.,Understanding mindfulness outcomes: a moderated mediation analysis of high-performance work systems,2021,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,"The purpose of the study was to explain the possible outcomes of mindfulness. The research studied the relationship between mindfulness and employee voice behaviour, affective commitment, job satisfaction, and burnout. The research added one contextual variable, high-performance work system, as a moderator. The sample of the study was faculty members of higher education (management) schools. The sample size was 1092 faculty members. Moderated mediation analysis was used to analyse the data and understand the positive as well as the negative relationship of high-performance work system. Findings indicated the significant positive relationship of mindfulness with employee voice behaviour, affective commitment, and job satisfaction. The research found a negative relationship between mindfulness and burnout. The moderated mediation analysis revealed the significant interaction effect of high-performance work system and mindfulness on consequence variables. To conclude the author found that the mindfulness practice is important for faculty members of higher education. Further the research concluded that mindfulness may enhance employee voice behaviour, which in turn increases satisfaction and commitment and reduces burnout. Such relationship is possible under high performance work system context. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"National Institute of Industrial Engineering, NITIE, Mumbai, India",English

The relationship between transformational leadership and psychological empowerment and the possible mediating role of psychological empowerment in the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational identification of employees was also studied. A hypothesized model was developed to examine the relationship between the constructs. Sample for the study comprised 199 employees from the IT sector. Instruments used were Multi-factor Leadership Questionnaire, Smidts et al.’s (2001) Organizational Identification Questionnaire and Spreitzer’s (1995) Psychological Empowerment Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS and structural equation modeling in AMOS. It was indicated that transformational leadership had positive and significant impact on organizational identification as well as psychological empowerment of employees. Psychological empowerment acting as a mediator between these two constructs was established. It was found that the developed model would pave way for more attention toward psychological empowerment among leaders and employees in organization. © ©The Author(s) 2020.",organizational identification; psychological empowerment; structural equation modeling; transformational leadership,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, NIT Rourkela, Odisha, Rourkela, India; Department of Psychology, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India",English
"Hagen I., Skjelstad S., Nayar U.S.",“I Just Find It Easier to Let Go of Anger”: Reflections on the Ways in Which Yoga Influences How Young People Manage Their Emotions,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"In this article we discuss how young people experienced a school-based yoga intervention. We pay particular attention to how yoga provides a space for young people to deal with their emotions. We base our discussion on qualitative data from young people in Norway who participated in the European research project “Hippocampus: Promoting Mental Health and Wellbeing among Young People through Yoga.” The qualitative results are based on experiences described by these young people in individual semi-structured interviews and in diaries or logs. Our data include nine interviews performed in the spring of 2019 with young people of Norwegian and refugee background in their late teens and early twenties. There were also 133 logs noted by the students exposed to the yoga intervention. In the qualitative interviews, young people talk about yoga and emotional management, improved sleep habits, and regulation. They also report improved ability to regulate and cope with stress. Yoga seemed especially beneficial for refugee trauma. In this article, we have chosen to focus on the utterances of young people about emotions, as those were quite dominant in our data, especially in the interview material. We have identified instances of emotional regulation, but also of emotional processes and changes of emotions, all of which were related to these young students practicing yoga. The impact of yoga on emotions illustrates the potential of yoga to improve the well-being and mental health of young people.

"Agrawal S., Krishna S.M.",Communication apprehension and psychological well-being of students in online learning,2021,Behavioral Sciences,"The current pandemic has modified how education, learning, and technology interact with one another inside universities. The usage of technology for instructional purposes raises the question of whether learning that happens in an online environment is as effective as traditional classroom models. Within this context, this study explores the psychological well-being of students during the COVID-19 pandemic, using an online cross-sectional survey. Data were collected from 246 university students currently studying at a private university in India. Hierarchical regression analysis and structural equation modelling were used to study the mediating effects between communication apprehension, perceived learning, and psychological well-being under the moderating effects of intention to use social media and psychological stress. Results show that higher intentions to use social media alleviated the negative effects of communication apprehension on perceived learning. Interestingly, it was also found that perceived learning had a significant positive relationship with psychological well-being when students experienced higher levels of psychological stress (eustress). Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the transactional theory of stress and coping, we attempt to integrate the findings related to these theories, which can be considered distinct to previous studies. Implications, limitations, and future directions for research and practice have also been discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

"Sarkar J.G., Sreejesh S., Sarkar A., Dwivedi Y.K.",Impact of self-brand connection on willingness to pay premium: Relevant mediators and moderators,2021,Psychology and Marketing,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how self-brand connection in an interactive multi-actor single-brand retail context can lead to consumers' willingness to pay premium through the sequential mediation of brand attitudes (intransigent and flexible) and brand love. Study 1 shows that self-brand connection strengthens (weakens) consumers' intransigent (flexible) brand attitude, thereby increasing their brand love and willingness to pay price premium. Furthermore, consumers' high level of cynicism attenuates brand love and willingness to pay premium for consumers' displaying flexible brand attitudes. Study 2 shows that favorable other customer perceptions can mitigate the detrimental impact of high consumer cynicism on consumers' brand responses. In Study 3, we found that other customers' favorable behaviors (over similarity and/or appearance) can best mitigate the negative effects of consumer cynicism on brand love and willingness to pay premium. The research contributes by showing how varying degrees of consumers' self-brand connection can develop willingness to pay premium through developing either intransigent (constructive route) or flexible (mitigating route) brand attitudes and brand love. For consumers harboring flexible brand attitudes accompanied with high cynicism, other customer perception serves as a conditioning tool, that alleviates their cynicism, and garners higher brand love as well as willingness to pay premium, and behavior dimension of other customer perception dominates in this quest. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",brand love; cynicism; flexible brand attitude; intransigent brand attitude; other customer perception; self-brand connection,"Department of Marketing, Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India; Marketing Management Area, Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode, Kozhikode, Kerala, India; Emerging Markets Research Centre (EMaRC), School of Management, Swansea University, Swansea, United Kingdom; Department of Management, Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Pune & Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, Maharashtra, India",English
"Talwar S., Talwar M., Tarjanne V., Dhir A.",Why retail investors traded equity during the pandemic? An application of artificial neural networks to examine behavioral biases,2021,Psychology and Marketing,"Behavioral biases are known to influence the investment decisions of retail investors. Indeed, extant research has revealed interesting findings in this regard. However, the literature on the impact of these biases on millennials' trading activity, particularly during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the equity recommendation intentions of such investors, is limited. The present study addressed these gaps by investigating the influence of eight behavioral biases: overconfidence and self-attribution, over-optimism, hindsight, representativeness, anchoring, loss aversion, mental accounting, and herding on the trading activity and recommendation intentions of millennials during the pandemic. An artificial neural network approach was used to analyze the data collected from 351 millennial men in Finland. The results revealed that herding, hindsight, overconfidence and self-attribution, representativeness, and anchoring influence both trading activity and recommendation intentions, albeit to varying extents. Notably, loss aversion and mental accounting influence only the recommendation intentions. Furthermore, the relationship of the two endogenous variables is nonlinear with herding, representativeness, and anchoring but is linear with other biases. In addition to the quantitative study, we also conducted a post hoc qualitative study with 19 millennials to evaluate the persistence of behavioral biases among them through the pandemic. © 2021 The Authors.

"Chinneimawi E., Nagarajan P., Menon V.",Caregiver Burden and Disability in Somatoform Disorder: An Exploratory Study,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Very few Indian studies have explored disability among patients with somatoform disorder and the burden experienced by their caregivers. We aimed to assess the levels of disability among patients with somatoform disorder and the levels of burden among their caregivers and compare these parameters against patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Participants included adults with a diagnosis of somatoform disorders (F45.0–F 45.9) (n = 28) or schizophrenia (F20.0–F20.9) (n = 28) diagnosed as per the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), clinical descriptions, and diagnostic guidelines, as well as their caregivers. The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 and Family Burden Interview Schedule were used to assess patient disability and caregiver burden, respectively. Independent Student’s t-test or chi-square test was used to compare relevant sociodemographic and clinical parameters. Results: Out of 56 patients, the mean (±SD) age of the sample was 38.6 (±10.5) years. Females constituted a slender majority of the sample (n = 29, 51.8%). The mean disability score of patients with somatoform disorders was slightly higher (83.6 ±20.9) than that of patients with schizophrenia (82.3 ±16.7). Similarly, the mean burden score of caregivers of patients with somatoform disorders was nominally higher (18.96 ±9.9) than that of caregivers of patients with schizophrenia (15.7 ±9.7). Neither of these differences approached statistical significance (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with somatoform disorders experience considerable levels of disability, and their caregivers go through various levels of burden in their daily life that is comparable to schizophrenia. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Caregiver burden; disability; schizophrenia; somatoform disorders,"Bethesda College of Nursing, Manipur, India; Dept. of Psychiatric Nursing, College of Nursing, Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pudhucherry, India; Dept. of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pudhucherry, India",English
"Bhattacharya M., Gravel N.",Is the preference of the majority representative ?,2021,Mathematical Social Sciences,"We show that a majoritarian relation is, among all conceivable binary relations, the most representative of the profile of preferences from which it emanates. We define “the most representative” to mean that it minimizes the sum of distances between itself and the preferences in the profile for a given distance function. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for such a distance to always be minimized by a majoritarian relation. This condition requires the distance to be additive with respect to a plausible notion of compromise between preferences. The well-known Kemeny distance does satisfy this property, along with many others.

"Dhir A., Talwar S., Kaur P., Budhiraja S., Islam N.","The dark side of social media: Stalking, online self-disclosure and problematic sleep",2021,International Journal of Consumer Studies,"The proliferation of social media usage has led to the manifestation of certain negative behaviours that are now referred to as the ‘dark side’ of social media use. These behaviours are a matter of concern, as they are detrimental to people's well-being. The present study examines the empirical association among social media stalking, online self-disclosure, social media sleep hygiene, compulsive social media use and problematic sleep, most of which have been previously recognized as key dark side behaviours. While social media stalking is a relatively new and under-explored phenomenon, its predecessor, the much-castigated cyberstalking, has received sufficient scholarly attention. This study's hypothesized associations are grounded in cognitive-behavioural theory, self-awareness theory and problem behaviour theory, which we test using cross-sectional data from 876 social media users. We further control for age and gender. The findings suggest that stalking and online self-disclosure drive compulsive use and poor sleep hygiene, with stalking being the chief driver in both cases. Problematic sleep is influenced by stalking, compulsive use and poor sleep hygiene, with sleep hygiene having the strongest effect, while poor sleep hygiene and compulsive use also partially mediate the association of both stalking and online self-disclosure with problematic sleep. © 2021 The Authors.

However, limited information is available about the same from India, due to the lack of validated instruments in regional languages for the same.This research aimed to translate, adapt, and validate the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), Spiritual Well-being Scale (SWBS), and Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scale in Hindi. Methods: The scales were translated into Hindi by following the translation–back-translation methodology as specified by the World Health Organization. Next, the Hindi versions of the scales were completed by 102 participants, and then, the participants completed either the Hindi or the English version of the scales after 3–7 days. Results: The Hindi versions of WEMWBS, MHLC, and SWBS have high cross-language equivalence with the English version of the scale, both at the level of the individual items and the various dimensions in all three scales, which was significant (P < 0.001). Cronbach’s alpha for the Hindi version of WEMWBS, SWBS, and MHLC scales was 0.92, 0.83, and 0.77, respectively. The Spearman–Brown coefficient was 0.82, 0.63, and 0.63 for WEMWBS, SWBS, and MHLC, respectively. As measured on the Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS), higher religiosity was associated with greater religious and existential well-being. Conclusion: The Hindi versions of WEMWBS, SWBS, and MHLC have good cross-language equivalence, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability. It is expected that these validated scales will stimulate more research in this area, focusing on evaluating the association of clinical parameters along with well-being and locus of control. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",locus of control; Validation; well-being,"Dept. of Psychiatry, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India",English
Malik S.,The nexus between emotional intelligence and types of knowledge sharing: does work experience matter?,2021,Journal of Workplace Learning,"Purpose: Owing to limited research exploring the role of emotional constructs on different types of knowledge sharing, this paper aims to examine the impact of emotional intelligence on two different types of knowledge sharing, namely, tacit knowledge sharing and explicit knowledge sharing. Further, this study also attempts to explore the moderating role of work experience between emotional intelligence-knowledge sharing relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A survey design methodology is used to collect data from 245 employees of global information technology (IT) companies located in India. Structural equation modelling technique was applied to test the hypothesised relationships among the constructs. Findings: The results indicate that emotional intelligence has a stronger positive effect on tacit knowledge sharing (ß = 0.78, p < 0.001) compared to explicit knowledge sharing (ß = 0.59, p < 0.001). Multigroup analysis results reveal that influence of emotional intelligence on tacit knowledge sharing was stronger for high experience group compared to low experience group. However, no significant differences were found based on work experience for the emotional intelligence-explicit knowledge sharing relationship. Practical implications: This study suggests suitable interventions that management can adopt to enhance tacit as well as explicit knowledge sharing in global IT organisations. Originality/value: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the differences that exists between tacit and explicit knowledge sharing and highlights the impact of emotional intelligence on these distinctively. It advances knowledge sharing literature and brings uniqueness by exploring the moderating role of work experience on emotional intelligence-knowledge sharing relationship in a non-western setting. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Emotional intelligence; Explicit knowledge sharing; IT industry; Knowledge sharing; Tacit knowledge sharing; Work experience,"Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India",English
"Gupta A., Choudhary P., Parida M.",Understanding and modelling risky driving behaviour on high-speed corridors,2021,Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,"This study explores the relationships among various factors influencing risky driving behaviours, particularly on high-speed corridors (expressways). A total of 546 samples are collected from licenced drivers through an online survey. Exploratory factor analysis confirms the four-factor solution and the same is verified using confirmatory factor analysis. These factors are individual aberrant driving behaviour (violations and errors), risky driving behaviour performed by surrounding vehicles and dangerous manoeuvres due to prevailing road environment. Structural equation modelling is used to establish the relationships amongst the aforementioned factors. The results of the study describe that observed risky driving behaviour on expressways is mostly affected by drivers’ individual aberrant driving (γ = 0.62) followed by risky driving behaviour performed by surrounding vehicles (γ = 0.39) and least affected by the road environment (γ = 0.36). The individual driving behaviour is mostly affected by violations (γ = 0.47) followed by errors (γ = 0.38). Furthermore, differences in Driving Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) scales are analysed with respect to the demographic variables. Results suggest that male and young drivers report more violations than female and older drivers, respectively, however, female drivers are more error prone than male drivers. The findings of the study can be useful to identify the potential road safety countermeasures to improve the driving style as well as the driving environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Errors; Expressway; Risky driving; Road environment; Violation,"Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India",English

They were assessed for parental consanguinity using the clinical interviews as well as DNA-based estimates. The latter was conducted by calculating the coefficient of inbreeding ‘f’. A participant was considered to have consanguineous parentage if his/her parents shared a common ancestor no more remote than a great-great-grandparent, corresponding to DNA-based estimates of ‘f’ ≥ 0.0156. Results: The rates of parental consanguinity assessed by clinical interview were comparable in both groups (Cases: 10.71 %, Controls: 7.25 %; χ2 = 0.493, p = 0.4825). However, DNA-based rates of parental consanguinity showed that ‘f’ was significantly higher among cases than controls (Mann-Whitney U = 11315.5; p = 0.022). Seventy-five cases (62.5 %) and 108 control participants (48.6 %) had ‘f’ ≥ 0.0156 (χ2 = 6.008; p = 0.014). The results were consistent across different quality control measures. Conclusion: Schizophrenia is associated with higher parental consanguinity, suggesting a role for multiple recessive risk alleles in its etiology. Replication in future studies in diverse settings would add further strength to this. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",DNA; Genetic; Genetic counseling; Inbreeding; Parental consanguinity; Schizophrenia,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, India; Department of Neurochemistry, National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, India; Department of Human Genetics, National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, India; Department of Psychiatric Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, India; Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Mediacal Sciences, Rishikesh, India; Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Western Psychiatric Hospital, Pittsburgh, United States; Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States",English

Sustainable CBT mainly emphasizes social, environmental, and cultural sustainability and gives power to local communities in any aspect of tourism management. This manuscript aims to propose a novel approach to examine the current status of sustainable CBT in the Indian Himalayan region context. In this regard, a comprehensive framework was developed using experts’ opinions, and the relevant literature in tourism studies was reviewed based on sustainable CBT. To this end, this study proposed an integrated decision-making method using Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and MULTIMOORA (Multiple Objective Optimization based on the Ratio Analysis plus Full Multiplicative Form) under Interval-Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (IVPFSs). Additionally, some comparisons were discussed with the outcomes obtained from the developed approach and those of extant ones to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. To confirm the applicability of the proposed IVPF-SWARA-MULTIMOORA approach to real-world decision-making problems, a sustainable CBT problem was considered as a case study. The final results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed approach as well as its consistency with the existing ones. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Community based tourism; Decision-making; Himalia region; Interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets; MULTIMOORA; Sustainable tourism development,"School of Economics, Liaoning University, Shenyang, Liaoning  110036, China; Department of Mathematics, Govt.

"Gupta R., Mahajan R., Bakhshi A., Gupta K., Singh D., Kaur B.",Fear vs. hope in India: Finding the silver lining amid the dark clouds of COVID-19,2021,Personality and Individual Differences,"COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic, and the associated high rates of morbidity and mortality have made individuals susceptible to mental health problems that affect their psychological well-being. Although individual strengths can shield the negative impact of adverse conditions, their protective role in the context of COVID-19 has not received much attention. This study examines the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health via rumination through the lens of hope as a personal psychological strength. This study employed a two-wave longitudinal design. Data was collected from 412 Indian participants with a time interval of three months and analyzed using a two-step approach to structural equation modelling. Fear of COVID-19 was found to a have negative effect on mental health through rumination. However, results from moderation analysis support the role of hope as a buffer against the indirect negative impact of fear of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes. As one of the first studies to demonstrate the role of psychological strengths of individuals in coping with the direct and indirect psychological ramifications of COVID-19 over a period of time, it contains important implications for the development of mental health interventions in the face of this global crisis. © 2021",COVID-19; Fear; Hope; Mental health; Pandemic; Rumination,"Department of Higher Education, Government of J&K, India; Department of Psychology, University of Jammu, India; IIM Rohtak, India",English
"Aggarwal S., Patton G., Berk M., Patel V.",Psychosocial interventions for self-harm in low-income and middle-income countries: systematic review and theory of change,2021,Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology,"Purpose: To synthesise the evidence on effectiveness, acceptability and the delivery mechanisms of psychosocial interventions for self-harm in low and middle income countries and to develop a pathway of change specific for self-harm interventions. Method: Studies reporting one or more patient or implementation outcomes of a psychosocial intervention targeting self-harm and conducted in low- and middle-income countries were included. Taxonomy of treatment components and a theory of change map was created using information from the studies. Results: We identified thirteen studies including nine randomised controlled trials (RCT), three non-RCTs, and a single experimental case design study. A single study using postcard contact and another using cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) reported a reduction in self-harm attempts. Suicidal ideations were significantly reduced with CBT, volitional help sheets and postcard contact in different studies. Suicide risk assessment, problem solving and self-validation were the most frequently used elements in interventions. Goal-setting was the technique used most commonly. Cultural adaptations of psychotherapies were used in two studies. High attrition rates in psychotherapy trials, limited benefit of the delivery of treatment by non-specialist providers, and variable benefit observed using phone contact as a means to deliver intervention were other important findings. Conclusion: There were no strong positive findings to draw definitive conclusions. Limited availability and evidence for culturally adapted interventions in self-harm, lack of evaluation of task sharing using evidence based interventions as well as a dearth in evaluation and reporting of various intervention delivery models in low- and middle-income countries were major literature gaps. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Low- and middle-income countries; Psychosocial interventions; Self-harm; Theory of change,"Public Health Foundation of India (Centre for Chronic Conditions), New Delhi, India; Faculty of Health, School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia; Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (Centre for Adolescent Health), Victoria, Australia; IMPACT-The Institute for Mental and Physical Health and Clinical Translation, School of Medicine, Barwon Health, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Orygen (Centre for Youth Mental Health), Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, Global Health and Social Medicine, Boston, MA, United States",English

Pandit S.A.,Advaita: Oneness as a Lived Reality—Examining Aspects of Profound and a Radical Psychology,2021,Psychology and Developing Societies,"It is all good to say, that the world is one! Are these idealistic/poetic ideas or could there be psychological pathways to experience oneness as a continuous realisation? This is not a question of philosophy or intellectual argumentation, but a question of living and being. There has been now interest in non-dual awareness in research as well (Josipovic, 2014). The objective of this article is to introduce a radical worldview—advaita vedānta that leads to profound cognitive, affective and behavioural implications of well-being beyond the surface level ideas of happiness. Advaita—which means ‘not-two’ is the most profound and radical of psychological theories Indic civilization has experienced and accepted as the epitome—the crown jewel. The Vedāntic worldview and practice with the background throb of all Indic values—of inclusion, love and truth vests in Advaita—oneness. In popular imagination, it has been both esoteric-cised and yet has remained un-commodified. Contrary to popular ideas that look at advaita as a speculative philosophy, advaita is understood as a rich psychological theory with a basis in cognition, knowing, as well as a living in oneness. The students of modern psychology, especially, in India are left poorer, if they are unable to review advaita and yet study consciousness, which is a booming area of research in modern psychology. Advaita is a continuous living realisation—termed as Jīvanmukti, the Vedāntic ideal of being free, while living. Examining the primary Saṃskrit text—Jīvanmukti-viveka, I describe Jīvanmukti—of living in continuous realisation of oneness, till the body drops down, as stated by the great muni, whose above-mentioned abhyāsa grantha—the application manual, is used across Hindu spiritual frameworks and monastic orders, till today. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",Advaita; Indian Psychology; Jīvanmukti; non-dual awareness; oneness; Vedānta,"School of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Heritage, Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth University, Adi Shankara Marg, Veliyanad, Cochin, Kerala, India",English

"Issac T.G., Ramesh A., Reddy S.S., Sivakumar P.T., Kumar C.N., Math S.B.",Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007: A Critical Appraisal,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: The sociocultural changes associated with globalization and development have weakened the traditional values and family support systems for senior citizens (age 60 years and above). There is an increase in the prevalence of elder abuse and difficulties in getting appropriate care and support. This has mandated legal measures to protect the rights of the senior citizens and provide them care and support by the family and other stakeholders. Consequent to being the signatory for the “Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002,” several countries, including India, have introduced legislation for the social protection of senior citizens. “The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens(MWP) Act, 2007” is an important legislation in India to safeguard the elderly from exploitation and abuse. Methods: This article critically evaluates the implementation of the MWP Act, 2007, and the related challenges in protecting senior citizens from abuse. The article will also highlight the proposed amendments in the Act to strengthen the effective implementation of legal protection for senior citizens and ensure their well-being and dignity. Conclusions: The MWP act is an important legal measure to ensure mainatinence and welfare of senior citizens and protect them from abuse and neglect. There is an immediate need to incorporate the necessary amendments so that the act gets more pragmatic value and becomes and important tool for elderly care and protection and reduce vulnerabilities and ensure holistic care with support in various bio-psycho-social domains. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Administrative law; elder abuse; geriatric psychiatry; social work and older clients; social work with the elderly,"Geriatric Psychiatry Unit, Dept. of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept. of Psychiatry, Vishwabharati Medical College and Hospital, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, India; Dept. of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Forensic Psychiatry Unit, Dept. of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

"Ramanathan P., Singh P.","‘Searching for Roots’: Exploring the Idea of Home in Tibetan Refugee Youth Living in Delhi, India",2021,Psychology and Developing Societies,"Home is a key aspect of place attachment signified by rootedness and ease; it is operationalised as a sense of being rooted to and feeling at ease in a particular place. Two studies were done to gain a nuanced idea of the concept of home as understood by Tibetan refugee youth living in Delhi. In study 1, based on in-depth interviews on 20 students of ages 18–25 years, a thematic analysis resulted in the global theme of ‘community as home’ indicating the central position of the community while talking about home. On the basis of this study, four variables were identified as key to the concept of home: in-group identification, group efficacy, social well-being and rootedness (home). Study 2 was designed to understand the relationship between these identified variables. Around 103 refugee youth (controlled for gender) aged 18–25 years completed the questionnaire. It was found that most of the variables were positively correlated to one another, except for group efficacy and social well-being. Further, the mediation analysis indicated that in the context of the community, higher levels of social well-being explained increased in-group identification, particularly when mediated by the presence of group efficacy. Overall, it was found that community seems to be integral to the concept of home for Tibetan refugee youth living in Delhi. Both studies expand upon existing literature on the concept of home and have further implications for the notion of home and the social well-being of Tibetan refugees. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",group efficacy; Home; in-group identification; social well-being; Tibetan refugee; youth,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India",English
Andrade C.,"The Limitations of Quasi-Experimental Studies, and Methods for Data Analysis When a Quasi-Experimental Research Design Is Unavoidable",2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"A quasi-experimental (QE) study is one that compares outcomes between intervention groups where, for reasons related to ethics or feasibility, participants are not randomized to their respective interventions; an example is the historical comparison of pregnancy outcomes in women who did versus did not receive antidepressant medication during pregnancy. QE designs are sometimes used in noninterventional research, as well; an example is the comparison of neuropsychological test performance between first degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. In QE studies, groups may differ systematically in several ways at baseline, itself; when these differences influence the outcome of interest, comparing outcomes between groups using univariable methods can generate misleading results. Multivariable regression is therefore suggested as a better approach to data analysis; because the effects of confounding variables can be adjusted for in multivariable regression, the unique effect of the grouping variable can be better understood. However, although multivariable regression is better than univariable analyses, there are inevitably inadequately measured, unmeasured, and unknown confounds that may limit the validity of the conclusions drawn. Investigators should therefore employ QE designs sparingly, and only if no other option is available to answer an important research question. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",confounding variables; multivariable regression; Quasi-experimental study; research design; univariable analysis,"Dept. of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neurotoxicology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

A study on under-five children in India",2021,Children and Youth Services Review,"Background: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-nCoV) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become the worst serious global risk to humanity in the last century and linked with various risk factors. Objective: To find out the risk zone associated with Coronavirus disease among children under-five age using malnourished status, pre-existing morbidity conditions, poor household environmental conditions, and also with case fatality rate (CFR) and active case rate (ACR) of COVID-19 in India. Data sources & methods: Data was collected from the 4th round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4, 2015–16, and CFR and ACR of COVID-19 related data collected from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on 18th May 2020. Mean, standard deviation, and Z-score statistical methods have been employed to identify the risk factors zone and Hot Spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi) has been done. Results: The states and union territories (UTs) which have a high composite vulnerability score (CVS) of COVID-19 among under-five children are in Meghalaya (CVS = 1), Uttar Pradesh (CVS = 0.93), Jharkhand (CVS = 0.86), Bihar (CVS = 0.74), Madhya Pradesh (CVS = 0.74), and Odisha (CVS = 0.55).

This is due to the event of globalization which led to the exponential growth of new technologies like assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART, one of the most iconic technological innovations of the twentieth century, has become increasingly a normal social fact of life. Since ART invades multiple human discourses—thereby transforming culture, society and politics—it is important what is sociological about ART as well as what is biological. This article argues in commendation of sociology of technology, which is alert to its democratic potential but does not concurrently conceal the historical and continuing role of technology in legitimizing gender discrimination. The article draws the empirical insights from local articulations (i.e., Odisha state in eastern India) for the understandings of motherhood, freedom and choice, reproductive right and rights over the body to which ART has contributed. Sociologically, the article has been supplemented within the broader perspectives of determinism, compatibilism alongside feminism. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",ART; determinism; gender; reproductive right; Science; social fact,"School of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India; Department of Sociology, Faculty of Arts, Central University of Allahabad, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India",English
"Tathgur M.K., Kang H.K.",Challenges of the Caregivers in Managing a Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder— A Qualitative Analysis,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological condition resulting in impaired social interaction and difficulty in understanding verbal and nonverbal communication. Caring for children with ASDs is challenging for both children and their caregivers. The child suffering from ASD starts to show the developmental outcome during early 2.5–3 years and continues thereafter till the child turns to an adult. Many caregivers face severe financial crises, high out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, and unemployment. Previous studies have reported a plethora of psychosocial problems affecting caregivers of children with ASD, ranging from stress, depression, anxiety, restrictions of activities, strain in marital relationships, and diminished physical health. Objective: This article aims to explore the concerns of the caregivers of children suffering from ASD. Aggregate themes were prepared based upon Corley and Gioia’s method of data structuring. Methods: After development and validation of an interview schedule, verbatim of seven caregivers of children with ASD were imported on the Atlas.ti version 8. Initial coding and final coding were followed by extracting the aggregate themes. Lincoln and Guba’s framework was used to assess the quality criteria as a part of qualitative analysis. Results: Caregivers face various challenges while caring for a child with ASD, with a negative impact on physical health, psychological well-being, societal reactions, and financial balance. Caregivers reported concerns related to service availability for ASD, poorly coping with the diagnostics, and disease processes. Conclusions: Caregivers undergo a lot of problems while taking care of a child with ASD. Health professionals must have an understanding of these problems and must provide the education and information for a better management. Furthermore, the findings of this study have policy implications for the health authorities for providing better health services to children diagnosed with ASD. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",aggregate themes; Autism spectrum disorders; caregivers concerns; coding; Lincoln and Guba’s framework,"Chitkara School of Health Sciences, Chitkara UniversityPunjab, India",English

Participants were 2,452 seventh and eighth grade adolescents (age range 12–16 years old; 49.1% girls) from China, Cyprus, India, and the USA. Adolescents completed questionnaires on peer attachment, social preference goals, and cyberbullying involvement (i.e., perpetration, victimization) at Time 1. Cyberbullying involvement was administered at Time 2 (one year later). Peer attachment and social preference goals were negative predictors of Time 2 cyberbullying involvement. Peer attachment and Time 2 cyberbullying perpetration were moderated by sex for Chinese adolescents only, as well as social preference goals and Time 2 cyberbullying perpetration for Chinese and the US adolescents. Sex did not moderate the associations among peer attachment, social preference goals, and Time 2 cyberbullying victimization. The findings of this study have implications for interventions focused on improving adolescents’ interactions with their peers at school and urges the need to develop bullying prevention programs sensitive to culture and sex.

Finding answers at the intersection of cultural values,2021,Journal of Consumer Behaviour,"Anti-consumption behaviours are frequently seen as an effective way for an individual to mitigate harm done to the natural world and foster sustainability. Despite explicit calls to investigate the drivers of anti-consumption behaviours, the effect of cultural values on anti-consumption remains under-researched. Our research examines the influence of two antecedents, cultural values (individualism and collectivism), and self-efficacy on anti-consumption behaviours in an emerging country setting. Our results indicate that cultural values influence anti-consumption behaviours. Consistent with our expectations, we found that collectivistic values positively influenced anti-consumption behaviours. This relationship remained valid across anti-consumption behaviours, such as voluntary simplicity and brand avoidance. Furthermore, beyond our initial expectation, this study demonstrated a positive indirect relationship between individualism and anti-consumption, which is activated through the self-efficacy pathway. These findings suggest that approaches for managing anti-consumption behaviour do not work equally well in all cultures, and that managers may need to fine-tune their international marketing strategies to ensure their effectiveness. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"Jindal Global Business School, O.

The Lunatic asylum, Bengaluru, later to become NIMHANS, was one of the early asylums and was administered by a princely state (Mysore). This study aims to evaluate socio-demographic and clinical characteristics as well as the treatment outcome of patients admitted to the Lunatic Asylum, Bengaluru in the early 20th century (1903–1911). Methods: A review of inpatient registers at the Lunatic Asylum, Bengaluru was conducted for the years 1903–1911 and analysed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: There were 620 admissions during this period and three-fourths were men (n = 465, 75.0 %). The mean age of the patients was 32.09 ± 10.29 years at the time of admission. Acute mania (n = 209, 33.7 %), chronic mania (n = 125, 20.2 %) and dementia (n = 65, 10.5 %) were the most frequent diagnoses. At the time of discharge, 35.5 % reported being cured and 12.1 % improved. The overall death rate of patients at the asylum was 27.2 %. Subjects who died had a mean duration of in-patient stay of 11.9 years. The mean age at death was 45.7 years with the comparable life-expectancy of the general population during the period being around 23 years. Conclusions: In-patients in the Lunatic Asylum, Bengaluru in the pre-antipsychotic era had a good outcome with approximately 50 % being cured or showing improvement and longer life expectancy than the general population. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bengaluru; Clinical characteristics; History of psychiatry; Lunatic asylum; NIMHANS; Outcome,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India",English

"Watkins T., Krishnan S., Barnes C.M.",A sleep and self-control model of cyber incivility at work,2021,Sleep Health,"Objectives: To conduct an empirical test of a conceptual model in which sleep duration would have an indirect negative effect on cyber incivility at work, mediated by self-regulatory fatigue and moderated by agreeableness. Design: A 2-week daily diary study in which employees completed daily surveys in the mornings and at the end of the workday. Setting: An observational study which measured sleep and work behaviors in the daily work lives of our participants. Participants: One hundred thirty-one adults who were full-time employees and were also enrolled in a 2-year Executive Post Graduate Program at a university in India. Measurement: Participants completed a baseline survey which included agreeableness as well as demographics and person-level control variables. At 7 AM each workday, we sent participants the morning survey which included the sleep measure. At 4 PM each workday, we sent participant the end of workday survey which included measures of self-regulatory fatigue, cyber incivility, and day-level control variables. Participants completed a total of 945 morning surveys and 843 afternoon surveys. Results: Results supported our model. Sleep duration was negatively associated with self-regulatory fatigue, which was positively related to cyber incivility. Agreeableness moderated the relationship between sleep duration and self-regulatory fatigue, as well as the indirect effect of sleep duration on cyber incivility. Conclusion: Employees have more self-regulatory fatigue and thus engage in higher levels of cyber incivility at work after a shorter night of sleep, especially if those employees are low in agreeableness. © 2021 National Sleep Foundation",Agreeableness; Cyber incivility; Experience sampling; Self-regulation; Sleep,"Engler College of Business, West Texas A&M University, Canyon, TX, United States; Information Systems Area, Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode, Kerala, India; Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States",English
Kumar R.,Impact of Societal Culture on Covid-19 Morbidity and Mortality across Countries,2021,Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology,"Researchers have begun exploring the impact of societal culture on Covid-19 outcomes (morbidity and mortality). However, emerging findings need integration with prior literature on societal culture and infectious diseases. Moreover, accumulation of knowledge warrants an update while overcoming certain limitations of samples as well as construct validity concerns. Accordingly, hypotheses are derived based on extant evidence proposing the impact of certain cultural practices on Covid-19 outcomes across countries. These hypotheses are tested using the cultural practice scores from GLOBE studies after controlling for certain covariates identified in literature. Multiple regression results reveal that societal culture significantly explains Covid-19 outcomes beyond the explanation due to control variables. Specifically, power distance and institutional collectivism show negative association with both Covid-19 morbidity and mortality. Additionally, performance orientation shows negative association with Covid-19 morbidity. It appears that power distance may ensure conformity to prescribed behaviors and features of performance orientation may facilitate swift and effective containment of Covid-19 cases. The significance of institutional collectivism—but not in-group collectivism—emerging as the form of collectivism showing negative association with Covid-19 outcomes is also discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.",collectivism; Covid-19; culture; GLOBE; institutional collectivism; performance orientation; power distance,"Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Kolkata, West Bengal, India",English

With increasing development and the convergence between the financial and ICT platforms, digital financial systems emerged which have opened new opportunities to close the wealth gaps between the “haves” and “have-nots” in the developing world. In this paper, we examine the short-run and long-run dynamics between economic growth, financial inclusion initiatives, and ICT infrastructure development in 20 Indian states over the period from 1991 to 2018. Using the Granger-causality technique, we show evidence of strong temporal causality between these variables in the short and long term.

"Irfan M., Yadav S., Shaw K.",The adoption of solar photovoltaic technology among Indian households: Examining the influence of entrepreneurship,2021,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Across the globe, renewable energy sources are well-recognized essential components of the energy consumption mix. Over the years, India has strategically enhanced solar energy consumption to meet its electricity deficit and reduce carbon emissions. However, the pace of adopting solar photovoltaic technology among Indian households remains lower than alternate micro-technologies like generators and inverters. Since literature suggests that entrepreneurship invokes awareness of social responsibility, activism, and environmental concerns, the role of entrepreneurship in adopting solar photovoltaic technology cannot be undermined, especially in addressing the challenges of low adoption rates. Considering these facts, this study empirically investigates the role of entrepreneurship and household characteristics either as barriers or drivers of adopting solar photovoltaic technology. The study sample contains 1551 Indian households extracted from the 72nd round of the Household Expenditure on Services and Durable Goods survey of 2014–2015. The probit regression model with sample selection bias correction is estimated to examine the likelihood of adopting solar photovoltaic technology in relation to alternate micro-technologies at the household level. The results reveal that entrepreneurship has a positive and significant influence on the likelihood of adopting solar photovoltaic technology. The findings also indicate that the likelihood increases with the family size, residence in rural areas, and being in the casual workforce. Conversely, the likelihood decreases with an increase in age, income, and being in the higher caste category. Based on the findings, several implications are discussed to promote the higher adoption rates of solar photovoltaic technology among Indian households. © 2021",Entrepreneurship; Household characteristics; Probit regression model; Solar photovoltaic technology,"Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad, Dhanbad, Jharkhand  -826004, India; Department of Anthropology, Dr. Harisingh Gour Central University SagarMadhya Pradesh  470003, India; Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad, Dhanbad, Jharkhand  826004, India",English

This study aims to examine child malnutrition among tribal children in India. The study uses data from the fourth round of National Family Health Survey. Bivariate and multilevel analyses have been used to fulfil the objectives of the study. Results reveal that overall prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among tribal children under three years of age was 41%, 30% and 43% respectively. Child age, sex, size at birth, age of the women at first birth and their education, duration of breastfeeding, religion, and wealth index are significantly associated with malnutrition among tribal children. The chances of stunting are more among tribal families with two or more children. On the other hand, the likelihood of underweight is more likely among tribal children who are suffering from diarrhoea and fever. Community variables like the place of residence, community education, and community wealth have a significant positive effect on stunting, wasting, and underweight, respectively. Therefore, the study recommended implementation of policies specific to the tribal population through improving individual as well as community-level education to ensure the reduction in malnourishment among tribal children in India. Moreover services provided by the government should be made accessible to this vulnerable group. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Breast-feeding; Community income; Malnutrition; Multilevel analysis; Tribes,"International Institute for Population Sciences, Govandi Station Road, Deonar, Mumbai, India; School of Public Health, ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai 77, India",English

The Dark Triad, especially psychopathy, impeded cognitive empathy, which highlights their indifference towards others’ emotional states. Further, the Dark Triad and primary psychopathy, but not secondary psychopathy, hampered emotion recognition, which was measured using multi-modal stimuli. We discuss how measures of psychopathy assess the construct differently, as well as how the relationship between psychopathy and emotion recognition is complicated. Finally, we found that those high on the Dark Triad spectrum were worse at recognizing the emotions of female actors on the Geneva Emotion Recognition Test. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Affective empathy; Alexithymia; Cognitive empathy; Dark Triad; Emotion recognition,"Department of Psychology, Monk Prayogshala, Mumbai, India",English

Use of a combination of more than one homicidal method was also found in various studies. Some of them found females as more common victims of multiple methods, whereas the others found males. Combination of methods commonly involved were sharp trauma, blunt trauma, and strangulation. This study was undertaken to know the pattern of homicide by multiple fatal methods at South Delhi. We have analyzed retrospective data of homicidal deaths in which multiple different fatal methods were used. We have also analyzed the number of perpetrators involved in those scenarios. The cases were autopsied at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi during the 20-year period from January 1996 and December 2015. There were 187 such reported cases where multiple methods were used for homicide, constituting 13.6% of all homicide deaths autopsied at the department. Multiple methods were used more commonly against female victims. Methods used in cases of male victims were the combination of head injury and stabbing in the chest/abdomen, followed by strangulation with smothering, whereas in cases of female victims, it was a combination of ligature strangulation and smothering which was most common, followed by the combination of smothering with throttling. Gunshot with stabbing was found to be a rare combination. A single perpetrator mostly used various asphyxial methods in combination or head injury with other methods such as stabbing and asphyxiation against male as well as female victims. Other combinations of methods, especially sharp weapon injury with blunt weapon injury or gunshot injury, suggest the involvement of more than one perpetrator. © The Author(s) 2019.",asphyxiation; blunt force; gunshot; head injury; multiple methods; sharp force; weapons,"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; ESIC Medical College, Faridabad, Haryana, India",English
"Tolbaños-Roche L., Menon P.",Applying the S-ART Framework to Yoga: Exploring the Self-Regulatory Action of Yoga Practice in Two Culturally Diverse Samples,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"Mindfulness practices form the core of numerous therapeutic programs and interventions for stress reduction and the treatment of different health conditions related to stress and life habits. Ways and means to regulate oneself effectively also form the foundation of the path of yoga in the accomplishment of holistic health and well-being. The self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence (S-ART) model can be considered as an overarching neurobiological framework to explain the self-regulatory mechanisms of well-being present in mindfulness-based practices. The current study, by connecting and applying the S-ART framework to the self-regulatory mechanisms in yoga and generating related hypotheses, provides a theory-led explanation of the action of yoga practices, which is sparse in the literature. Testing the S-ART model in yoga in two culturally diverse samples, assessing the model-mapped psychological mechanisms of action, and exploring the influence of perseverance in yoga practice are the original contributions of this study. The study sample comprised 362 yoga practitioners and non-practitioners (197 Indian and 165 Spanish), who completed four tests of psychological variables indicative of the aforementioned three S-ART abilities. These tests were Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), Experiences Questionnaire-Decentering (EQ-D) subscale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and Relational Compassion Scale (RCS). The results indicated significantly better self-awareness and self-regulatory abilities in yoga practitioners (Indian and Spanish in a combination) than non-practitioners, reflected in higher levels of interoceptive awareness and decentering abilities. Moreover, perseverance in yoga practice acted as a significant predictor of self-awareness and self-regulation in practitioners. An analysis of each cultural sample revealed some differences. Yoga practice and perseverance in it acted as a significant predictor of interoceptive awareness and decentering in Indian practitioners having more than 1 year of sustained yoga practice, but for the Spanish participants, physical exercise and frequency of yoga practice acted as better predictors of interoceptive awareness and decentering in comparison to yoga practice and perseverance in it. The obtained results suggested that the S-ART model provided preliminary but promising evidence for the self-regulatory mechanisms of action in yoga practice within a culturally diverse sample of yoga practitioners. This study also widens the scope of generating further hypotheses using the S-ART theoretical framework for testing the self-regulatory mechanisms of action in yoga practice. © Copyright © 2021 Tolbaños-Roche and Menon.",S-ART model; self-regulatory action; well-being; yoga; yoga practitioners,"Department of Clinical Psychology, Psychobiology and Methodology, Section of Psychology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad de La Laguna, San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain; Scientific Research Department, Kaivalyadhama Yoga Institute, Lonavala, India",English
"Sehrawat K., Vij M., Talan G.",Understanding the Path Toward Financial Well-Being: Evidence From India,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"Many countries are taking steps to establish national strategies to improve the financial well-being (FWB) of their people. However, FWB as a term is still in the infancy stage with a handful of models developed in the context of developed countries. Thus, there is a need to understand FWB from a multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional approach to draft and implement efficient strategies, especially in the context of developing countries like India. In this study, we have performed path analysis to identify the specific constituents of financial literacy, financial behavior (FinB), and personality traits that affect the FWB (perceived and objective) of an individual in Indian context. Survey responses of 349 respondents are analyzed to empirically validate the proposed relationships using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The analysis mostly provides support to existing literature and challenges some. The findings provide support to 12 out of 17 tested effects with eight hypotheses. The understanding of pathways that lead to increased FWB of individuals has the potential to facilitate effective policy-making and designing of curriculum to support efforts of individuals toward higher FWB and responsible FinBs. © Copyright © 2021 Sehrawat, Vij and Talan.",financial literacy; financial well-being; India; psychological factors; responsible financial behaviors,"Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India; University School of Management Studies (USMS), Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, India",English

It drew on a sample of 699 Indian and Israeli participants (ages 18–65) from urban settings and used questionnaires to measure cognitive well-being, demographics, EI, and mental well-being. EI was assessed using the Self Report Emotional Intelligence (SREIT); cognitive well-being was assessed using the Personal Well-being Index; mental well-being was assessed using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). The effect of demographic variables was tested using the two-sample T-test or the Chi-square test. The associations between EI, mental, and cognitive subscales were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression with stepwise selection. Results indicated MBP affected EI in both cultures, but Indian participants showed higher EI, and Israeli participants showed lower EI. Israelis also reported higher mental well-being. Future research should examine EI as ability (we examined it as a trait) thus contributing to a better understanding of the similarities and differences between trait and ability EI in different cultures.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived stress, anxiety level, and mental health of medical students as well as to explore the knowledge of COVID-19 among Indian medical students. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among the undergraduate medical interns and postgraduate medical residents using the online data collection form. The form consisted of five domains (sociodemographic details, knowledge assessment, perceived stress assessment, generalized anxiety disorder-7 assessment, and assessment of the perceived level of change in social habits and personal hygiene related to COVID-19 outbreak). The statistical analysis of the responses was carried out by the Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Two hundred participants filled the distributed survey, 61% (n = 122) were males. The mean knowledge score of 200 participants was 4.27 ± 1.45. The participant had a mean perceived stress score of 18.35 ± 6.28, and the females had a significantly higher perceived stress level than the male (P = 0.037). About 10% (n = 20) of the participants reported high perceived stress level (27-40), and moderate stress (score 14-26) was reported in 69% (n = 138) of the participants. However, only 21% (n = 42) of the participants reported low stress (0-13). While only moderate anxiety (score 10-14) was reported in 16% (n = 32) of the participant and 4% (n = 8) of the participants reported severe anxiety (score >14).

Scholars have argued that emotional tears serve an attachment function: Tears are thought to act as a social glue by evoking social support intentions. Initial experimental studies supported this proposition across several methodologies, but these were conducted almost exclusively on participants from North America and Europe, resulting in limited generalizability. This project examined the tears-social support intentions effect and possible mediating and moderating variables in a fully pre-registered study across 7007 participants (24,886 ratings) and 41 countries spanning all populated continents. Participants were presented with four pictures out of 100 possible targets with or without digitally-added tears. We confirmed the main prediction that seeing a tearful individual elicits the intention to support, d = 0.49 [0.43, 0.55]. Our data suggest that this effect could be mediated by perceiving the crying target as warmer and more helpless, feeling more connected, as well as feeling more empathic concern for the crier, but not by an increase in personal distress of the observer. The effect was moderated by the situational valence, identifying the target as part of one's group, and trait empathic concern. A neutral situation, high trait empathic concern, and low identification increased the effect. We observed high heterogeneity across countries that was, via split-half validation, best explained by country-level GDP per capita and subjective well-being with stronger effects for higher-scoring countries. These findings suggest that tears can function as social glue, providing one possible explanation why emotional crying persists into adulthood. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Attachment; Cross-cultural; Emotional crying;

"Roy Sarkar S., Mitra Mazumder P., Chatterjee K., Sarkar A., Adhikary M., Mukhopadhyay K., Banerjee S.",Saccharomyces boulardii ameliorates gut dysbiosis associated cognitive decline,2021,Physiology and Behavior,"Saccharomyces boulardii, a probiotic yeast is well prescribed for various gastrointestinal disorders accompanied by gut dysbiosis such as inflammatory bowel disease, bacterial diarrhea and antibiotic associated diarrhea. Gut dysbiosis has been associated with central nervous system via gut brain axis primarily implied in the modulation of psychiatric conditions. In the current study we use Saccharomyces boulardii as a therapeutic agent against gut dysbiosis associated cognitive decline. In mice, gut dysbiosis was induced by oral Ampicillin Na (250 mg/kg twice-daily) for 14 days. While in the treatment group S. boulardii (90 mg/kg once a day) was administered orally for 21 days along with 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Gene expression studies revealed antibiotic mediated decrease in the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Firmicutes and Clostridium which were restored by S. boulardii treatment. Cognitive behavioral studies showed a parallel reduction in fear conditioning, spatial as well as recognition memory which were reversed upon S. boulardii treatment in these animals. S. boulardii treatment reduced myeloperoxidase enzyme, an inflammatory marker, in colon as well as brain which was increased after antibiotic administration. Similarly, S. boulardii reduced the brain acetylcholine esterase, oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which were altered due to antibiotic treatment. S. boulardii treatment also protected hippocampal neuronal damage and restored villus length and crypt depth thus normalizing gut permeability in antibiotic treated animals. Hence, we conclude that S. boulardii prevented antibiotic associated gut dysbiosis leading to reduced intestinal and brain inflammation and oxidative stress thus preventing hippocampal neuronal damage and eventually reversing gut dysbiosis associate cognitive decline in mice. © 2021",Cognition; Gut dysbiosis; Gut microbiota; S. boulardii,"Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India; Department of Bioengineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India",English

Despite evidence of the cost effectiveness of brief interventions (BIs) for hazardous drinking, implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is rare due to several human resource–related barriers. This paper describes the processes and outputs of a study aimed at systematically developing a mobile phone–delivered BI to overcome such barriers. Methods: This is a mixed methods study with four steps: (1) Review of existing relevant evidence base by extracting data from studies cited in two recent, relevant and high-quality systematic reviews; (2) In-depth interviews (IDIs) with 11 national experts in addictions research and practice, and 22 hazardous drinkers; (3) Delphi survey (2 rounds) to identify components for the intervention package through consensus building; and (4) Content and intervention development workshops with a range of stakeholders to develop the intervention package. Results: The research team sourced 72 journal articles from two selected systematic reviews. Key content areas extracted from the studies included facts and statistics about health related to drinking behavior, self-reflection, goal-setting messages, motivational messages, and skills to manage risky situations. The IDIs with experts and hazardous drinkers endorsed most of these content areas as well. The Delphi survey achieved consensus on 19 content areas, which included targeted recommendations, personalized feedback and information, goal management, and coping skills. The content and intervention development workshops resulted in an intervention package delivered over 8 weeks, with the following seven themes guiding the content of the weekly messages: safe drinking/health education, alcohol reduction, drinking and risk management, drinking alternatives, situational content, urge management, and maintenance and relapse prevention. Conclusion: The research team designed this study to consider contextual factors while developing the intervention, which is important to ensure acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Interestingly, the contextually informed intervention components had several commonalities with BIs developed and tested in high-income countries. © 2021",Brief interventions; Hazardous drinking; India; Intervention development; mHealth,"Centre for Global Mental Health, Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom; Addictions Research Group, Sangath, H No 451 (168), Bhatkar Waddo, Socorro, Bardez, Porvorim, Goa  403501, India; Columbia University, New York, United States; Department of Psychology, University of Bath, United Kingdom; Tees, Esk and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom",English

Given that individuals who believe that life is like a zero-sum game are likely to perceive their daily interactions with others as unfair, we expected that individuals with high BZSG experience more negative affect and fewer positive one, resulting in a lower satisfaction with life. In addition, we examined whether country-level BZSG may play a moderating role in these associations. Data were collected from student samples (N = 7146) in 35 countries. Multilevel modelling revealed that perceived social antagonism in social relations is negatively associated with satisfaction with life and that this relationship is mediated by both positive and negative affect at the individual level. The relation of individual BZSG and negative affect on satisfaction with life were weaker in societies with higher country-level BZSG, suggesting that the effects of BZSG may be less detrimental in these countries. These findings extend previous knowledge about predictors of life satisfaction and suggest that social beliefs might also be an important factor that influences subjective well-being. The contribution of the study is that the separate treatment of life satisfaction and positive and negative affect may be helpful in many research situations, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective. © 2019, The Author(s).",Belief in a zero-sum game; MML; Subjective well-being; SWLS,"Institute of Psychology, University of Gdansk, Bazynskiego street 4, Gdansk, 80-309, Poland; University of Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, Warsaw, Poland; National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation; Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands; University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa; Airlangga University, Surabaya, Indonesia; University of Oradea, Oradea, Romania; Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur, Nepal; Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russian Federation; University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico; Universidad Tecnológica de Panamá, Panama City, Panama; Faculty of Management and Social Communication, Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland; Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), CIS-IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; Federal University of Paraíba, João Pessoa, Brazil; University Malaysia Sabbah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia; Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia; Karnatak University, Dharwad, India; Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic; S.

An Interdisciplinary Journal ","Detecting cognitive states during learning tasks is an essential component in neurocognitive experiments for assessing and enhancing the cognitive performance of individuals. Studies have demonstrated that mental state recognition systems utilizing brain signals are proficient in the automated monitoring of learners’ cognitive states. The current study focuses on developing an efficient individualized and cross-subject cognitive state assessment model based on Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns during learning tasks. For this study, EEGs of 20 healthy subjects were recorded during a resting state followed by a learning task and examined EEG activations patterns in a wide perspective of feature types and rhythms. The extracted features included time-domain features such as Hjorth parameters, Wavelet-based features, and Spectral entropy. Three classifiers, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Linear Discriminant Analysis were employed to recognize the mental state. A new EEG-based attention index using band ratios is proposed and is demonstrated as an effective predictor for recognizing attentive reading. The proposed model can yield recognition performance with an accuracy of 92.9% in the subject-dependent approach and 77.2% in the subject-independent approach with the Support Vector Machine Classifier. The findings are useful for the design and development of neurofeedback systems that monitor and enhance the cognitive performance in healthy individuals, as well as in individuals with cognitive deficits. © 2021 Babeş-Bolyai University.

To facilitate cross-cultural research, we validated an instrument measuring four employee silence motives (i.e., silence based on fear, resignation, prosocial, and selfish motives) in 21 languages. Across 33 countries (N = 8,222) representing diverse cultural clusters, the instrument shows good psychometric properties (i.e., internal reliabilities, factor structure, and measurement invariance). Results further revealed similarities and differences in the prevalence of silence motives between countries, but did not necessarily support cultural stereotypes. To explore the role of culture for silence, we examined relationships of silence motives with the societal practices cultural dimensions from the GLOBE Program. We found relationships between silence motives and power distance, institutional collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Overall, the findings suggest that relationships between silence and cultural dimensions are more complex than commonly assumed. We discuss the explanatory power of nations as (cultural) units of analysis, our social scientific approach, the predictive value of cultural dimensions, and opportunities to extend silence research geographically, methodologically, and conceptually. © 2021 The Authors.

"Noman M., Kaur A., Nafees N.",Covid-19 fallout: Interplay between stressors and support on academic functioning of Malaysian university students,2021,Children and Youth Services Review,"Covid-19 has impacted the lives of everyone around the world, including university students. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on all economies, resulting in a huge loss of employment. As a result, university students are anxious about their job prospects upon graduation. The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of two stressors – employment anxiety and financial anxiety and two supports - university support and lecturer support on dropout intention and academic performance on university students with well-being and purpose in life being the mediators. This quantitative was carried out in Malaysia using 436 final-year undergraduate students. The full mediation model indicated that the university and lecturer support mitigates the two stressors' effects through well-being and purpose in life. Students who reported better support systems reported lower academic concerns and were less likely to drop out than those who reported less support from their university and lectures.

This study attempts to understand the effects of the changing climate on rural individuals by investigating their feelings and experiences of perceived changes in the home environment and village life. Thirty-four in-depth interviews were conducted during the months of May–June 2019 in two districts—Gaya and Jehanabad of South Bihar, India. The findings reveal that the rural population have experienced changes in climate such as a rise in the incidence of heatwaves, erratic rainfall patterns, delay in monsoon onset, early drying of water resources, and loss of particular tree and bird species. Worries and uncertainties of the rural population have emerged from the experiences of involuntary separation from traditional farm activities, forced adaptation strategies, loss of cultural and religious practices, and reduced self-worth in coping with the deteriorating environment. The changing climate instigates feelings of emotional distress, resulting in adverse mental health and psychological well-being outcomes. It is concluded that the changing climate is responsible for the loss of traditional village customs and nature-related cultural practices, subsequently inducing solastalgia among the rural population. © 2021 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",climate change; distress; environment; rural; solastalgia,"Department of Psychological Sciences, Central University of South Bihar, Gaya, India; Department of Environmental Sciences, Central University of South Bihar, Gaya, India",English
"Simione L., Raffone A., Mirolli M.","Acceptance, and Not Its Interaction with Attention Monitoring, Increases Psychological Well-Being: Testing the Monitor and Acceptance Theory of Mindfulness",2021,Mindfulness,"Objectives: According to the influential Monitor and Acceptance Theory (MAT), mindfulness includes the two components of attention monitoring and acceptance, which, in conjunction, can explain its benefits on psychological well-being: monitoring alone would increase affective reactivity (MAT tenet 1b), but when combined with acceptance, it would lead to increased psycho-physical well-being (MAT tenet 2b). However, the studies cited in support to MAT are not completely consistent with the theory, Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study to further test it. Methods: In a pool of 154 participants, we measured the two mindfulness components with the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, while also assessing ill-being or psychological distress in terms of depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances, and psychological well-being in terms of life satisfaction and happiness. We then conducted hierarchical regression analysis on these data for assessing the role of monitoring, acceptance, and their interaction on the other psychological variables. Results: Our results show that monitoring alone marginally predicted few ill-being variables, whereas acceptance strongly predicted both reductions in psychological symptoms and increases in well-being. Moreover, no significant interaction between monitoring and acceptance was found for any of the tested variables. Conclusions: The present study provides very little support for the two tested MAT tenets. On the contrary, in line with most of the available literature, our results strongly support the alternative view according to which the beneficial effects of mindfulness on psychological outcomes depend mostly on acceptance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Acceptance; Attention monitoring; Emotional reactivity; Mindfulness; Monitor and Acceptance Theory; Well-being,"Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie della Cognizione, CNR, Rome, Italy; Dipartimento di Psicologia, “Sapienza” Università di Roma, Rome, Italy; School of Buddhist Studies, Philosophy and Comparative Religions, Nalanda University, Rajgir, India",English

Drawing from literatures on the impact of chronic and situational disempowerment on behavioral risk-taking to enhance status, we hypothesized that activating feelings of disempowerment would increase women of color’s interest in stronger and riskier products meant to lighten skin tone quickly and effectively. In two experiments (Experiment 1: N = 253 women and 264 men; Experiment 2: replication study, N = 318 women) with distinct samples of Indian participants, we found that being in a state of psychological disempowerment (vs. empowerment) increased Indian women’s preference for stronger and riskier skin lightening products but not for milder products. Indian men’s interest in both types of products was unaffected by the same psychological disempowerment prime. Based on these findings, we recommend increased consideration among teaching faculty, research scholars, and clinicians on how feeling disempowered can lead women of color to take risks to lighten their skin as well as other issues of intersectionality and with respect to colorism. We also encourage the adoption of policies aimed at empowering women of color and minimizing access to harmful skin lightening products. © The Author(s) 2021.",behavioral risk-taking; colorism; disempowerment; economic disadvantage; gender bias; intersectionality,"National University of Singapore Business School, Singapore; Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India; Hoover Institution, Stanford UniversityCA, United States; UCL School of Management, United Kingdom; INSEAD, Singapore",English

One, Artificial Intelligence's (AI's) Machine Learning (ML) techniques have the potential to help separate information and misinformation, but this capability has yet to be empirically verified in the context of COVID-19. Two, while older adults can be particularly susceptible to the virus as well as its online infodemic, their information processing behaviour amid the pandemic has not been understood. Therefore, this study explores and understands how ML techniques (Study 1), and humans, particularly older adults (Study 2), process the online infodemic regarding COVID-19 prevention and cure. Study 1 employed ML techniques to classify information and misinformation. They achieved a classification accuracy of 86.7% with the Decision Tree classifier, and 86.67% with the Convolutional Neural Network model. Study 2 then investigated older adults' information processing behaviour during the COVID-19 infodemic period using some of the posts from Study 1. Twenty older adults were interviewed. They were found to be more willing to trust traditional media rather than new media. They were often left confused about the veracity of online content related to COVID-19 prevention and cure. Overall, the paper breaks new ground by highlighting how humans' information processing differs from how algorithms operate. It offers fresh insights into how during a pandemic, older adults—a vulnerable demographic segment—interact with online information and misinformation. On the methodological front, the paper represents an intersection of two very disparate paradigms—ML techniques and interview data analyzed using thematic analysis and concepts drawn from grounded theory to enrich the scholarly understanding of human interaction with cutting-edge technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",AI; COVID-19 pandemic; Information-misinformation; Interview; Machine learning techniques; Older adult,"University of Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business School, DeHavilland Campus, Hatfield.

Bhattacharyya S.,A small step towards unification of economics and physics,2021,Mind and Society,"Unification of natural science and social science is a centuries-old, unmitigated debate. Natural science has a chronological advantage over social science because the latter took time to include many social phenomena in its fold. History of science witnessed quite a number of efforts by social scientists to fit this discipline in a rational if not mathematical framework. On the other hand a tendency among some physicists has been observed especially since the last century to recast a number of social phenomena in the mould of events taking place in physical world and governed by well-known systems and equations of physics. It necessitated the introduction of social physics as a new inter-disciplinary subject. Obviously this attempt is aimed at explaining hitherto unsolved or highly debated issues of social science. Physicists are showing special interest on problems on economics, ranging from some topics of normative economics to the movement of prices of derivatives. Statistics has been widely used in these attempts and at least two sub-disciplines of the subject, namely, stochastic process and time series analysis deserve special mention. All these research activities gave birth to another inter-disciplinary subject named as econophysics. Interestingly, global financial crisis of 2007–08 has revived the need of determination of prices of derivatives in a more accurate manner. This article adumbrates a sketch of the theoretical synthesis between physics and economics and the role played by statistics in this process. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Econophysics; Mathematization of economics; Monte Carlo simulation; Social physics; Statistical inference; Stochastic process,"New Business and Actuarial Department, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Eastern Zonal Office, L.I.C.I.

There has been remarkably little systematic analysis of Brixton test performance in the prototypical neurodegenerative disorder of the frontal lobes: behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) or evaluation of the test’s ability to distinguish frontal from temporal lobe degenerative disease. We carried out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of Brixton performance in 76 patients with bvFTD and 34 with semantic dementia (SD) associated with temporal lobe degeneration. The groups were matched for demographic variables and illness duration. The bvFTD group performed significantly more poorly (U = 348, p <.0001, r =.58), 53% of patients scoring in the poor–impaired range compared with 6% of SD patients. Whereas bvFTD patients showed problems in rule acquisition and switching, SD patients did not, despite their impaired conceptual knowledge. Error analysis revealed more frequent perseverative errors in bvFTD, particularly responses unconnected to the stimulus, as well as random responses. Stimulus-bound errors were rare. Within the bvFTD group, there was variation in performance profile, which could not be explained by demographic, neurological, or genetic factors. The findings demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of the Brixton test in identifying frontal lobe degenerative disease and highlight the clinical value of qualitative analysis of test performance. From a theoretical perspective, the findings provide evidence that semantic knowledge and the capacity to acquire rules are dissociable. Moreover, they exemplify the separable functional contributions to executive performance. © 2020 The Authors.

Pandya S.P.,Spiritual counselling mitigates loneliness and promotes affect balance for older empty nester couples: A study in some international cities,2021,Counselling and Psychotherapy Research,"This article reports a study examining the impact of a spiritual counselling programme (SCP) on older empty nester couples' loneliness experiences and affect balance. Since empty nesters are usually couples with a greater likelihood of interdependence in the psychosocial domains, there is a need to examine interdependent effects or actor–partner interdependent effects of interventions. Twenty-four online SCP sessions were conducted throughout the year with the intervention group couples who were assessed on loneliness and affect balance outcomes pre- and post-test compared with couples in the waitlist control group. The impact of SCP was significant, with lower loneliness post-test scores and higher affect balance for couples from Russian and European cities, Christians, those who were well educated, in good health, those who attended at least 75% of the SCP sessions and regularly practised at home. Number of SCP sessions attended and home practice mediated the relationship between demographic predictors and outcomes. Results of the actor–partner interdependence model analyses indicated that intervention group couples' post-test outcome measure scores were mutually interdependent and associated. Wives whose husbands attended more SCP lessons and regularly practised at home were more likely to do so themselves. This investigation fills the gap in empty nest literature of examining the efficacy of a specifically designed intervention for empty nesters. © 2020 British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy",affect balance; empty nest syndrome; loneliness; older couples; spiritual counselling,"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English
"Shukla M., Pandey R.",Identifying the transdiagnostic and unique domains of emotion regulation difficulties in subclinical conditions of anxiety and co-occurring anxiety-depression,2021,Current Psychology,"It is well documented that emotion regulation difficulties are linked with various forms of psychopathology including anxiety and depression but the literature is still inconclusive regarding whether emotion regulation difficulties are transdiagnostic or pathology-specific. We speculate that certain types of emotion regulation difficulties may be transdiagnostic while others may show specificity. The present study attempts to empirically validate this speculation and tries to explore the common (transdiagnostic) and unique domains of emotion regulation difficulties associated with psychometrically identified subclinical groups of anxious and anxious-depressed individuals. University and college students (N = 192) were assessed on self-report measures of emotion regulation difficulties, positive-negative affect, depression, and trait and free-floating anxiety and classified into anxious, anxious-depressed, and normal groups based on the results of cluster analysis. Both subclinical groups reported overall higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties than normals, with anxious-depressed group showing more difficulties than anxious group. While difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviour, lack of emotional awareness and emotional clarity were common across anxious and anxious-depressed groups, the anxious-depressed group showed a unique profile of emotion regulation difficulties characterized by non-acceptance of emotional response, impulse control difficulties, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies. Findings of discriminant function analysis revealed that while anxious-depressed group was characterised by difficulties in regulating emotions, the anxious group presented difficulties in emotional insight. The findings highlight the possible role of both unique and transdiagnostic components of emotion regulation difficulties in the development/maintenance of psychopathologies and have significant implications for predicting future development and psychotherapeutic management of these disorders. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Anxiety; Depression; Emotional regulation; Negative affect; Positive affect; Transdiagnostic,"Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India",English

A Psychometric Analysis,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"Background: Cross-cultural evidence on the factorial structure and invariance of the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 is lacking for South Asia. Recommendations on the use of unit-weighted scores of these scales (the sum of items’ scores) are not well-founded. This study aims to address these contextual and methodological gaps using data from a rural Indian population. Methods: The study surveyed 1,209 participants of the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program aged 30–60 years (n at risk of diabetes = 1,007 and n with diabetes = 202). 1,007 participants were surveyed over 2 years using the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7. Bifactor-(S – 1) modeling and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis were used. Results: Factor analysis supported the existence of a somatic and cognitive/affective subcomponent for both scales, but less explicitly for the GAD-7. Hierarchical omega values were 0.72 for the PHQ-9 and 0.76 for the GAD-7. Both scales showed full scalar invariance and full or partial residual invariance across age, gender, education, status of diabetes and over time. Effect sizes between categories measured by unit-weighted scores versus latent means followed a similar trend but were systematically higher for the latent means. For both disorders, female gender and lower education were associated with higher symptom severity scores, which corresponds with regional and global trends. Conclusions: For both scales, psychometric properties were comparable to studies in western settings. Distinct clinical profiles (somatic-cognitive) were supported for depression, and to a lesser extent for anxiety. Unit-weighted scores of the full scales should be used with caution, while scoring subscales is not recommended. The stability of these scales supports their use and allows for meaningful comparison across tested subgroups.

"Palaniappan P., Easwaran K.",Theory of Mind Deficits and Their Influence on Functional Impairment in Remitted Phase of Bipolar Disorder,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Functional impairment has been convincingly established in the euthymic/ remitted phase of bipolar disorder (BD). Though deficits in social cognition, especially theory of mind (ToM), predict functional impairment, the association has not been consistently proven. Methods: Thirty remitted subjects with BD (as per DSM 5) and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were screened for eligibility and the sociodemographic details and ToM scores, that is, first-order ToM, second-order ToM, and Faux pas, were collected. In subjects with BD, functioning was assessed using Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) and illness variables were collected. Results: No significant difference was found in occupation or education between the groups. Remitted subjects with BD had statistically significant deficits in all domains of ToM, that is, first-order ToM (r = 0.65), second-order ToM (r = 0.69), and Faux pas (r = 0.75). Significant correlations existed between first-order ToM and FAST total score, as well as second-order ToM and FAST total score, but the correlations dropped after controlling for duration of illness and number of depressive episodes. Quantile regression analysis showed that the only factors which predicted global functional impairment was a higher number of episodes (βτ= –0.45, SE = 3.51, t = 0.13, P = 0.04), while all other illness variables and ToM failed to predict the global functioning. Conclusion: Though there seems to be an association between ToM and functioning, only illness variables predicted functional impairment in subjects with BD. We need prospective studies to delineate the contributors to functional impairment. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",bipolar disorder; euthymic; functioning; theory of mind,"Dept. of Psychiatry, PSG Institute of Medical Sciences Research, Coimbatore, India",English
"Annapally S.R., Jagannathan A., Kishore T., Daliboyina M., Kumar C.N.",Development of a Supported Education Program for Students with Severe Mental Disorders in India,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: The onset of severe mental disorders (SMDs) is during adolescence or young adulthood, which affects the well-being and the educational aspirations of the students. Models of supported education practiced in the West are not culturally suitable for Indian students or the Indian education system. This study aimed to develop a Supported Education Program (SEP) for students with SMDs to help them with academic reintegration in an Indian context. Methods and Material: To develop the SEP, a realist review was done, followed by an in-depth interview with eight mental health professionals (MHP) and nine lecturers, using a validated interview script. After each interview, interim analysis and modifications were done to improve the rigor of the interview. After all interviews, the SEP was circulated for a second round of iteration for consensual validation by four mental health experts. The outcome of the entire process was the final version of SEP for students with SMDs. Results: The final SEP had two broad themes and 18 subthemes from the qualitative thematic analysis: theme 1 included issues and strategies relevant to the client or caregivers, and theme 2 was pertinent to the education system. Conclusion: The SEP developed and validated for people with SMDs has distinctive components: one for the individual and caregiver and the other for the educational system. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",higher educational goals; severe mental disorders; students; Supported education program,"School of Social Sciences/Psychology, Christ University (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept. of Psychiatry Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept. of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept. of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English
"D’cruz M., Andrade C.",Barriers to Impact Factor Growth in Two Major Psychiatry Journals in India,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Despite exponential growth in Indian research, Indian journals have low impact factors. A previous study by one of the authors (CA) of this paper showed that articles published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP) under-referenced previously published relevant papers in the same journal. Based on this, we decided to investigate the citation characteristics of contemporary scientific articles published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine (IJPM). Methods: The citation characteristics of scientific articles published in 2018 (Vol 40, issues 1–6) in the IJPM were examined to determine how well the authors cited relevant articles published during the past ten years in the IJPM and the IJP. Results: There were 145 and 142 citation-worthy articles in the IJPM and the IJP, respectively; of these, 85.5% and 65.5%, respectively, had not been cited. Conclusions: Authors publishing in the IJPM under-reference previous relevant research published in the IJPM and IJP. This suggests unawareness of, deliberate disregard of, or even disdain for prior Indian research in the field. Additionally, if Indian researchers do not cite previous Indian research in the field published in Indian journals, the citation metrics of Indian journals will not grow. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",citation indices; Impact factor; Indian Journal of Psychiatry; Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine; Indian psychiatry; Indian research,"Geriatric Psychiatry Unit, Dept. of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept. of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neurotoxicology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

Existing research has identified significant deficits in social cognitive skills independent of mood states and neurocognitive deficits, which could indicate the potentiality of this domain to be an endophenotype for bipolar disorder. Methods: The current study assesses the impairments in social cognition in patients with bipolar disorder and their first degree relatives, simultaneously testing for neurocognition as well, and comparing their performance to healthy controls. Fifty four participants were recruited, with 18 participants in each group. MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery was used to test neurocognition and Social Cognition Rating Tool in Indian Setting was administered for testing social cognition. Results: Significant deficits were found in social cognition and neurocognition (at p<.01) in the patient group when compared to both probands and healthy controls but no difference between probands and healthy controls. This finding established impairments in socio-cognitive functioning in remitted patients. Conclusion: The study has identified persistent deficits in social and neuro-cognition despite remission, having significant clinical implications in terms developing remediation programs for social cognition and planning early intervention as social cognition deficits have been identified as potential risk factors. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",bipolar disorder; first degree relatives; neurocognition; Social cognition,"Dept. of Clinical Psychology, SriRamchandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Porur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; Dept. of Clinical Psychology, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India; Dept. of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India",English

"Balachandran A., James K.S.",A multi-dimensional perspective on the gender gap in health among older adults in India and China: Application of a new ageing measure,2021,Ageing and Society,"A continuous rise of female life expectancy above that of males among older adults in India and China may give the impression that the relative gender gap in health in these countries is decreasing. However, given the systemic gender bias against older females in these countries across multiple dimensions of health, a fuller understanding of the gender gap in health calls for a multi-dimensional perspective. We estimate a multi-dimensional old-age threshold (MOAT) that specifies different old-age thresholds for female and male populations which accommodates multiple dimensions related to physical, intellectual and general health. We use the MOAT to evaluate the multi-dimensional gender gap in India and China by differencing the MOAT for females with that of males. Females in both countries have a lower MOAT than their male counterparts, indicating an earlier advent of 'old age' for females. The multi-dimensional estimates of the gender gap are also higher than the estimates based on only one dimension of health. A considerable level of variation is also observed in the gender gap across provinces. The study illustrates the need to understand the gender gap in health in India and China from a multi-dimensional perspective and provides an innovative way to quantify such a gap. Province-specific as well as health dimension-specific interventions are vital in reducing the gender gap among older adults in these countries.

"Lahiri D., Cappa S.F.",Left hemispheric stroke in a professional artist: A prospective case study,2021,Cortex,"Several papers have investigated the effect of stroke on creativity. While initial evidence favored right hemispheric dominance in artwork creation, subsequent well-founded research has established the left hemispheric participation in creativity, supporting the idea of bi-hemispheric role in artistic production. We here describe the case of a renowned artist who suffered a left hemispheric ischemic stroke involving the occipito-temporal region and subsequently manifested several difficulties in producing visual artworks. We documented his recovery phases in a prospective way during the initial months following stroke and observed that, although his constructional abilities recovered to a significant extent over 3 months, spontaneous creation was persistently impaired. The right hemispheric role in visual art is linked mainly to visuo-spatial skills and global attention, while left hemispheric participation is thought to be related to focal attention and visual imagery. Our case study lends support to the idea that art is a bi-hemispheric function with important complementary contributions from both the right and left hemisphere. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Art; Creativity; Hemispheric asymmetry; Visual imagery,"Neurology, R.G.

There is limited literature evaluating home environmental trends and predictors in the low- and middle-income country settings. Aims: Determine the trends of early childhood home environment changes between 6 and 36 months of age, and the factors associated with these changes. Study design: Longitudinal community-based birth cohort follow-up study in a semi-urban slum in Vellore, South India. Subjects: Consecutive sampling of a birth cohort between March 2010 and February 2012. Outcome measures: Home environment was objectively assessed using the ‘Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment’ (HOME) scale. Predictors of change in the home environment over time also were analyzed. Multivariable linear regression models and linear mixed effect models were used to identify the factors associated with HOME score at individual time points and over-a-time period, respectively. Results: The birth cohort enrolled 251 children with a follow-up of 235, 228 and 218 children at 6, 24 and 36 months, respectively. The socio-economic status (SES) was the single biggest predictor for the HOME score at each time point, with increasing strength over time. Maternal education predicted home environment at 24 months, while maternal depression was negatively associated at 6 and 24 months of age. SES and maternal factors contributed to the overall change in the HOME score. Maternal factors predicted relational home environmental change over time. Conclusion: SES and maternal factors consistently predicted early childhood home environment at 6, 24 and 36 months of age and its change over time. It is important to support maternal education and wellbeing along with socio-economic measures to optimize early childhood environment. © 2020 The Authors.

Consequently, a tremendous amount of energy is consumed with high carbon dioxide emissions, which necessitates that cloud service providers (CSP) develop high quality of service (QoS) strategies to address such challenges. Proper management and utilization of resources ensure a well-balanced load distribution that makes energy consumption sufficient. Developing new algorithms and exploring efficient methods and techniques is highly desired for the management of virtualized DCs. This research proposes Finite Automata using Ant Colony Optimization with Spanning Tree (FAACOST), a machine-learning concept for managing cloud resources in a multi-tier environment. The overall objective is to minimize energy consumption through data placement leverage and virtual machines (VM) consolidation. The proposed technique's efficiency was benchmarked on four performance metrics (machine learning, dynamic nature, scalability, and QoS). Based on the extensive experiments conducted, FAACOST recorded an energy consumption of 132 w with 20 tasks compared to the benchmarked techniques that consumed 363 w. The experimental results show that FAACOST achieves the optimal number of physical machines (PMs) and is more energy-efficient. © 2021",Bio-inspired; Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Finite automata; Metaheuristic technique; Resource provisioning,"Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Dass roadBauchi State, Nigeria; SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu  603203, India; University of North Florida, Jacksonville, FL  32224, United States; Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, 315100, China; Federal Polytechnic Bauchi, Dass RoadBauchi State, Nigeria",English
"Tiwari D.N., Misra G.",Personality and Value Preference as Predictors of Social Well-being,2021,Journal of Human Values,"This article explored the role of personality disposition and value preference as predictors of social well-being in the context of ecological setting. Ecological contexts like rural and urban are critical, particularly in a developing country like India, because they represent significant disparities and variations in the lived experiences of the people. The participants (n = 360) from the age range of 15–65 years (M = 33.50, SD = 11.99) were drawn from two ecological settings, that is, rural (Gorakhpur Region, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India) and urban (National Capital Region of Delhi, India) and from both the genders. They completed the measures of social well-being, value preference and personality dispositions. The results showed that the different facets of social well-being were differentially related to the aspects of personality and value preference. Ecological setting had significant influence on the measures of personality disposition, value preference and social well-being. Regression analysis showed that except neuroticism, all other factors of personality had consistent positive contribution as the predictors of social well-being. It was also observed that social value and growth factors of value preference had significant contribution, whereas personal value and protection—factors of value preference—had negative contribution as the predictors of social well-being. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",ecological setting; personality; Social well-being; value,"Department of Applied Psychology, Ramanujan College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India; Department of Psychology, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India",English

The study is cross-sectional and non-experimental. Data were obtained from 630 information technology (IT) employees from South India, adopting ‘power calculations’. The analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 for Windows and LISREL version 8.72. Results reveal that leadership effectiveness and psychological well-being have a significant positive association with workplace spirituality, and this, in turn, has an impact on the work outcomes of intention to quit, job involvement and OBSE. Workplace spirituality can limit any negative associations of leadership effectiveness and psychological well-being with work outcomes. This research adds to the existing body of knowledge in the spirituality literature by drawing attention to the positive aspects of the interplay between spirituality, leadership transformation and well-being at work. The article concludes that building core values anchoring spirituality would lead to greater connectedness and healthier employee outcomes. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",India; job involvement; leadership; organization-based self-esteem; psychological well-being; Workplace spirituality,"Department of Management Studies, Pondicherry University (A Central University), Pondicherry, India; Indian Institute of Management Raipur, Atal Nagar, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India",English

The study aims to derive a non-invasive technique to estimate pilot's cognitive workload and study their correlation with standard physiological parameters. Initially, we conducted a set of user trials using well-established psychometric tests for evaluating the effectiveness of pupil and gaze-based ocular metrics for estimating cognitive workload at different levels of task difficulty and lighting conditions. Later, we conducted user trials with the NALSim flight simulator using a business class Learjet aircraft model. We analyzed participants' ocular parameters, power levels of different EEG frequency bands, and flight parameters for estimating variations in cognitive workload. Results indicate that introduction of secondary task increases pilot's cognitive workload significantly.

Rajkumar R.P.,Suffering and Salutogenesis: A Conceptual Analysis of Lessons for Psychiatry From Existential Positive Psychology (PP2.0) in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on the thoughts, emotions and behavior of millions of people all around the world. In this context, a large body of scientific literature examining the mental health impact of this global crisis has emerged. The majority of these studies have framed this impact in terms of pre-defined categories derived from psychiatric nosology, such as anxiety disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. These constructs often fail to capture the complexity of the actual experiences of the individuals being studied; more specifically, they describe these experiences exclusively in terms of disease, while neglecting their potentially adaptive or “salutogenic” aspects. Similarly, discussion of psychological assistance for these individuals has largely been confined to a reiteration of “evidence-based” psychological or pharmacological techniques which can be delivered using remote access technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches are likely to be of mixed efficacy. Conversely, “negative emotions” or distressing psychological experiences may actually be functional in the setting of a disaster or crisis, serving to minimize harm, maximize social coherence and compliance, and facilitate adherence to safety measures. The limitations of the “conventional” approach are, to a certain degree, inherent to the prevailing medical model of mental health. Beyond these considerations lies the concept of “salutogenesis,” a term which refers to the innate capacity of individuals to create and maintain health and well-being in the face of adversity. Using principles derived from the second wave of positive psychology (PP2.0), particularly its emphasis on the totality of human experience and the possibility of deriving meaning and character growth from suffering, this paper conceptually analyses the relevant aspects of salutogenesis and PP2.0, and proposes an alternate approach for addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach, while acknowledging the utility of the conventional medical-psychotherapeutic model in specific cases, reduces the risk of medicalizing human experience, and provides individuals and communities with opportunities for growth and adaptation. The benefits of this proposal could potentially extend far beyond the current crisis, offering an opportunity for the field of psychiatry and mental health research to move away from a purely “disease-centered” model. © Copyright © 2021 Rajkumar.",COVID-19; mental health; positive psychology; psychiatry; salutogenesis,"Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry, India",English
"Patil S., Datar M., Shetty J., Naphade N.",Psychological consequences and coping strategies of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at a tertiary care hospital': A qualitative study,2021,Asian Journal of Social Health and Behavior,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat and has affected physical as well as mental health adversely. There had been an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases in India from May to October 2020. Isolation, hospitalization, and stigmatization were significant issues in COVID-19 crisis. The literature is sparse on the mental health effects on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to describe the psychological consequences and coping strategies of COVID-19 patients admitted to tertiary health-care hospital. The objectives were (1) to assess the psychological consequences in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital, (2) to assess the coping strategies in these COVID-19 patients, and (3) to find correlations of sociodemographic characteristics, psychological consequences, and coping strategies of these COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional qualitative study, 100 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection participated. In-depth interviews were conducted using semi-structured questionnaire. The narratives were coded into themes and correlations of variables generated were done using Chi-square test. Results: The most common themes about the psychological state of patients were loneliness and isolation (56%), adjustment issues in the hospital (54%), and concerns about family members (32%). Patients who had family members also suffering from COVID-19 illness (24%) had more concerns about their health (Chi-square 25.209, P = 0.00) and had worries of their future (Chi-square 7.023, P = 0.008). Females had more worries about family members (Chi-square 16.295, P = 0.00) and had more concerns about their own health (Chi-square 5.71, P = 0.01). The most common coping strategies used by patients were digital communication with family members (82%), distraction (58%), and communicating with other co-patients (30%) to deal with their psychological distress. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection leads to psychological distress due to multiple factors. Timely interventions with support for effective coping mechanisms can help in alleviating the distress. © 2021 Medknow.

However, amidst these changes, experiences of COVID-19 patients and their perception of the outside world's attitudes toward them appears to be less attended in literature which formed the basis for the current study's objectives. Using qualitative methodology, the present study explored the experiences, perceptions and attitudes of patients and their care-givers' toward COVID-19. The thematic analysis emerged with four major themes. Psychological Experiences of People was generated prominently with sub-themes indicating the perceived experiences like fear of spreading diseases to others, and the need for psychological counseling. Attitude of others toward patients and caregivers revealed that family members and relatives played a major positive role on the patient's mental health, however, the neighbor's stigmatized attitude led to several undesired behaviors. Social Connectedness was another major theme derived from the study. Altruistic volunteers, a sub-theme of Social connectedness have indicated that amidst these negative factors, one can spread social harmony by motivating and supporting the victims with basic needs, financial support, hope and social empathy. Opinions of participants for digital technology through technological aids and preventive measures emphasized an overall positive attitude as it helped the society, in general to maintain social connections as well to curb the rate of COVID-19 cases. © Copyright © 2021 Pandey, Astha, Mishra, Greeshma, Lakshmana, Jeyavel, Rajkumar and Prabhu.",altruistic volunteers; belongingness; social empathy; social support; undesired behaviors,"Central University of Karnataka, Gulbarga, India; Gulbarga University, Gulbarga, India",English

This study examines its prevalence and correlates among HCWs in Karnataka State, India. HCWs who attended a workshop to improve mental health well-being during COVID-19 completed an anonymous online questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographics, domains assessed include occupational characteristics, COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety/depression, substance use, suicidality, lifestyle and family functioning. Of the 3083 HCWs who completed the survey (response rate-51.4 %), anxiety disorder and depression was highest among those with frontline COVID-19 responsibilities (anxiety disorder-26.6 %, depression-23.8 %). Prevalence was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities (anxiety disorder: 23.9 % vs 15.5 %), (depression: 20.0 % vs 14.2 %). In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions.

"Joshi A., Joshi A., Chatterjee I., Kantak C., Puntambekar A.",Facilitator lessons from online psychoeducational group for relational well-being in India during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,Journal of Family Therapy,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of individuals, along with their couple and familial relationships, necessitating an effective response. Teletherapy offers an option to address these relationship concerns amidst pandemic-specific mobility restriction. Against this setting, Sukoon, a project of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, India, initiated a five-session online psychoeducational group series on relational wellbeing. This paper explores facilitator’s reflections and learnings based on session documentation and facilitator notes. Preparing well and selecting participants carefully for online psychoeducational groups was critical to success. Effectiveness was enhanced by flexibly adapting the therapy process (didactic and interactive elements) to fit online delivery and the cultural context. Identifying the potential of online psychoeducational groups for relational wellbeing could make it a valuable addition to the COVID-19 pandemic mental health response toolkit. Practitioner points: Effective preparation and careful selection of group members is key to the success of therapist facilitated online psychoeducational groups. Psychoeducational groups comprising didactic and interactive elements are more suitable for effective online group processes. Use of co-facilitators managing various channels of communication (audio, chat) is important. Group facilitators need to be cognisant of challenges of online medium and address them in an ongoing manner. © 2021 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice",COVID-19 pandemic; facilitator lessons; online psychoeducational group; relational well-being,"School of Human Ecology, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Naoroji Campus, Academic Building 1, Deonar, Mumbai  400088, India; Sukoon Director, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India; Project Coordinator, Sukoon, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India; Programme officer, Sukoon, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India; Research officer, Sukoon, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English
"Menon V., Varadharajan N., Praharaj S.K., Ameen S.",Quality of peer review reports submitted to a specialty psychiatry journal,2021,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Background: Though peer review is at the heart of scholarly publishing, peer review reports are not commonly investigated. We aimed to analyse the quality and structure of review reports submitted to the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine (IJPM). Methods: We systematically analysed the structure, tone, and quality of peer review reports of all original articles submitted to the journal between January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020. Quality assessment was done using the 8-item Review Quality Instrument (RQI). Results: A total of 527 review reports from 291 original articles were analysed. More than two-thirds of review reports were provided as inline comments (n = 368, 69.8 %). Most of the review reports were not well-structured; only a few provided a summary (n = 64, 13.2 %) or divided the comments into major and minor ones (n = 12, 2.5 %). Nearly a quarter had negative wordings (n = 117, 24.1 %) and a minority had a frankly unprofessional tone (n = 43, 8.8 %). The global rating was “poor” (n = 266, 50.5 %) or “below average” (n = 203, 38.5 %) for most reports. Conclusion: Most of the peer reviews submitted to the IJPM were not structured and obtained low scores on the RQI domains.

"Guha S., Chandra H.",Measuring and Mapping Disaggregate Level Disparities in Food Consumption and Nutritional Status via Multivariate Small Area Modelling,2021,Social Indicators Research,"Although India has progressed significantly on several health outcomes but the state of food and nutrition security in the country still requires sustained efforts to accelerate achievement. Existing data based on socio-economic surveys conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) produce precise measures of food and nutrition security status at state and national level. However, these surveys cannot be used directly to produce reliable district or further smaller domain level estimates because of small sample sizes which lead to high level of sampling variability. Decentralized administrative planning system in India demands the availability of disaggregate (e.g. district) level statistics for target oriented effective policy planning and monitoring, as food and nutrition security is often unevenly distributed among the subsets of relatively small areas. But, due to lack of district level estimates, the mapping and analyse related to food and nutrition security measures are restricted to state and national level. As a result, disaggregate level dissimilarity and variability existing in food and nutrition security are often masked. This article delineates multivariate small area estimation (SAE) technique to obtain reliable and representative estimates of food consumption and nutrition status at district level for the rural areas of state of Uttar Pradesh in India by combining latest round of available Household Consumer Expenditure Survey 2011–2012 data of NSSO and the Indian Population Census 2011. The empirical evidence indicate that the estimates generated by SAE approach are reliable and representative. Spatial maps showing district level inequality in distribution of food and nutrition security in Uttar Pradesh is also produced. The disaggregate level estimates and spatial maps of food and nutrition security are directly relevant to sustainable development goal indicator 2.1.2—severity of food insecurity. The estimates and maps of food insecurity indictors are anticipated to offer irreplaceable information to administrative decision-makers and policy experts for identifying the regions requiring more attention. Government of India has recently launched number of schemes for the benefit of rural population in the country and these estimates will be useful for fund allocation as well as in the monitoring of these schemes. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.",Census; Household consumer expenditure survey; Joint modelling; Multivariate small-area estimation; NSSO,"ICAR-Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute, Library Avenue, New Delhi, India",English

Method: Dispositional optimism and possible correlates were assessed across 61 countries (N = 15,185; mean age = 21.92; 77% female). Mean-level differences in optimism were computed along with their relationships with individual and country-level variables. Results: Worldwide, mean optimism levels were above the midpoint of the scale. Perhaps surprisingly, country-level optimism was negatively related to gross domestic product per capita, population density, and democratic norms and positively related to income inequality and perceived corruption. However, country-level optimism was positively related to projected economic improvement. Individual-level optimism was positively related to individual well-being within every country, although this relationship was less strong in countries with challenging economic and social circumstances. Conclusions: While individuals around the world are generally optimistic, societal characteristics appear to affect the degree to which their optimism is associated with psychological well-being, sometimes in seemingly anomalous ways. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",cross-cultural; dispositional optimism; well-being,"Department of Psychology, The University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; Department of Psychology, University of California, Riverside, CA, United States; Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina; University of Melbourne, Australia; University of Graz, Austria; Universidad Católica Bolviana, La Paz, Bolivia; Federal University of Paraíba, Brazil; Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás, Brazil; Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria; University of British Columbia, Canada; Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada; Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Chile; Universidad de La Frontera, Chile; Durham University, United Kingdom; ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China; Fundación Universitaria del Área Andina, Bogotá, Colombia; Universidad Antonio Nariño, Bogotá and Universidad de Ciencias Aplicadas y Ambientales, Bogotá, Colombia; University of Crete, Crete, Italy; Technological Institute of Crete, Crete, Italy; Hellenic American University, Crete, Italy; University of Zagreb, Croatia; Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic; University of Copenhagen, Denmark; University of Warwick, United Kingdom; CLLE, Université de Toulouse, CNRS, UT2J, France; Univ Rennes, LP3C (Laboratoire de Psychologie: Cognition, Comportement, Communication) - EA 1285, Rennes, F-35000, France; Al Azhar University-Gaza (Palestine), Gaza, Palestine; Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, Georgia; Humboldt University, Germany; University of Goettingen & Leipniz Science Campus Primate Cognition, Germany; Bielefeld University, Germany; The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Lingnan University, Hong Kong; Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary; Karoli Gaspar University of the Reformed Church in Hungary, Hungary; AMRI Institute of Neurosciences, Kolkata, India; Jnana Prabodihini's Institute of Psychology, Pune, India; Univeritas Ahmad Dahlan, Indonesia; Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Indonesia; Coventry University, Indonesia; Ono Academic College, Israel; University of Campania, Luigi Vanvitelli, Italy; University of Milan-Bicocca, Italy; Hiroshima University, Japan; Ritsumeikan University, Japan; Yamanashi University, Japan; University of Jordan, Jordan; Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, Kenya; University of Latvia, Latvia; Vilnius University, Lithuania; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia; EGADE Business School Monterrey, Mexico; Fundación Universidad de las Américas Puebla, Mexico; Tilburg University, Netherlands; University of Utrecht, Netherlands; Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria; University of Oslo, Norway; The Delve Pvt Ltd, Pakistan; University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; Pontificia Universidad Católica del Peru, Peru; University of Philippines-Diliman, Philippines; Institute of Psychology of The Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland; Kazimierz Wielki University, Poland; University of Warmia and Mazury, Poland; CICPSI, Faculdade de Psicologia, Universidade de Lisboa, Alameda da Universidade, Lisboa, 1649-013, Portugal; West University of Timisoara, Romania; St. Petersburg State University, Russian Federation; Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar-Sénégal, Senegal; University of Novi Sad, Serbia; National University of Singapore, Singapore; Slovak Academy of Sciences, Slovakia; University of Ljubljana, Slovenia; University of Cape Town, South Africa; Chonnam National University, South Korea; Yonsei University, South Korea; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain; University of Barcelona, Spain; Lund University, Sweden; University of Basel, Switzerland; Université de Genève, Switzerland; University of Zurich, Switzerland; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Taiwan; Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan; Faculty of psychology, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; Bogaziçi University, Turkey",English

Studies have shown their vulnerabilities to depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia. In a developing country like India, with a rising caseload, resource limitations, and stigma, the adversities faced by the physicians are more significant. We attempted to hear their “voices” to understand their adversities and conceptualize their resilience framework. Methods: A qualitative approach was used with a constructivist paradigm. After an initial pilot, a socio-demographically heterogeneous population of 172 physicians working in COVID-designated centers were purposively sampled from all over India. Following in-depth virtual interviews using a pre-formed semi-structured guide, the data was transcribed and translated verbatim. The interview was focused on their challenges, needs, and processes of coping and support. Charmaz’s grounded theory was used for analysis supplemented by NVivo 10 software. Results: Fear of infection, uncertainty, stigma, guilt, and social isolation emerged as the main challenges. Simultaneously, their “unmet needs” were flexible work policies, administrative measures for better medical protection, the sensitivity of media toward the image of HCW, effective risk communication for their health, and finally, social inclusion. Their resilience “framework” emerged as a process while navigating these adversities and consisted of three facets: forming a “resilient identity,” managing the resilience, and working through the socio-occupational distress. The role of mental well-being, social network, peer support, problem negotiation, and self-care emerged as the key coping strategies. Conclusion: The study findings support the global call for better psychosocial health and quality of life of the frontline HCWs. Their “unheard voices” explored in the study can anchor subsequent resilience-enhancing interventions and policies. Guidelines focusing on the psychological wellbeing of frontline HCWs need to be grounded in their unmet needs and lived experiences. © Copyright © 2021 Banerjee, Sathyanarayana Rao, Kallivayalil and Javed.",challenges; COVID-19; frontline workers; healthcare workers; physicians; psychosocial; resilience,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Department of Psychiatry, JSS Medical College and Hospital, JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, Mysuru, India; Department of Psychiatry, Pushpagiri Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Thiruvalla, India; Pakistan Psychiatric Research Centre, Fountain House Lahore, Islamabad, Pakistan; World Psychiatric Association (WPA), Geneva, Switzerland",English
"Maurya K.K., Agarwal M., Srivastava D.K.",Perceived work–life balance and organizational talent management: mediating role of employer branding,2021,International Journal of Organization Theory and Behavior,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the effect of perceived work–life balance on the perceived level of employer branding attraction valueand organizational talent management. Accordingly, the structural model is developed that delineates the interactions among these and explores the mediating effect of employer branding attraction value between the relationship of work–life balance and organizational talent management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on survey results and review of literature in terms of their implications for the proposed framework. Data have been collected by convenience incidental sampling from middle-level executives working in different information and technology (IT) companies. The model and posited hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling analysis. Findings: Perceived work–life balance was found to be positive and significantly predicted the employer branding attraction value and organizational talent management. The study also showed that there exists a significant and positive correlation between employer branding attraction value and perceived organizational talent management. Further, employer branding attraction value found to be a mediating construct between the relationship of work–life balance and organizational talent management. Research limitations/implications: The present study will add insight into the human resource practitioners to design cost-effective and prolonged popular practices in order to meet the employees work and personal expectations under the organizational association. The research investigated issue within focused IT sector employees to understand and solve the issues generated with changing factors in an organizational environment such as increasing women participation, duel earning couple, and maintaining the difference between various categories of employees at the practice level. Social implications: The study has value at both the scholarly and practice level. At a scholarly level, the research investigated an important contemporary issue at both level individual as well as organizational level. In practice if organization implements people friendly work-life balance policies, then this will be surely be helpful in organizational productivity in form of talent management and employer branding and further this will improve the personal and professional performance of most elementary component of developing society. Originality/value: Work–life balance much more depends upon employees' perception, but so far the study has neglected the impact of this perception on other organizational attributes maintained under human resource management. Changes in demographic characteristics and interchangeable role of the youth population in organizations and society as well thrive for the newer approach to deal with the personal and professional aspects of the employees. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Employer branding; Human resource management; Organizational talent management; Work–life balance,"HRD, VBS Purvanchal University, Jaunpur, India; Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India; Office of CAG of India, Bangalore, India",English

The Zr-CdSe (doped) and CdSe (un-doped) nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The inclusion of Zr ion into the CdSe nanoparticles matrix was confirmed by SEM-EDAX and XRD studies. TEM studies confirm the zirconium ions are uniformly doped over the CdSe surface. The photocatalytic degradation performance of Zr doped and un-doped CdSe nanoparticles was examined for the degradation of IC dye under solar light irradiation. The experimental results indicated that the Zr-doped CdSe possessed greater photocatalytic activity in comparison to un-doped CdSe. Photodegradation process parameters such as the initial concentration of the dye, as well as the amount of catalyst and time were investigated. The photocatalytic degradation rate was favored by a high concentration of the solution in respect to Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. © 2021, Iranian Environmental Mutagen Society.

This study was aimed to investigate the gamma spectral power of the brain in patients with first episode psychosis, using high-resolution electroencephalography. Methodology: Twenty-nine neuroleptic naïve/free male patients with non-affective psychosis as per ICD 10 DCR clinical criteria were compared with thirty age, sex, education and handedness matched healthy individuals as controls. All participants underwent 192-channel resting electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Gamma spectral power was calculated for low (31–50 Hz) and high-gamma (51–70 and 71–100 Hz) bands and compared between two groups using MANOVA and supplementary one-way ANOVA. Pearson correlation and linear regression analyses were conducted between spectral power parameters and various clinical variables. Results: The gamma spectral power in 31−50 Hz and 51–70 Hz frequency bands was found to be significantly higher in patients in most brain regions. Duration of illness predicted the gamma spectral power in both right and left frontal regions of the brain in the frequency range 31−50 Hz and 71−100 Hz, as well as in the right temporal region in 71−100 Hz range, where it was negatively correlated.

However, its role as a risk-marker in BD is not well researched. In the present study, we investigated the role of FER and the corresponding prefrontal neurohemodynamic changes (PNHC) with functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) in patients with BD and subjects at high risk for BD compared to healthy subject. Methods: Using a cross-sectional case-control design we compared 14 patients with first episode mania (FEM) in remission (BD group), 14 healthy siblings of BD patients (HR group), and 13 matched healthy subjects (HC group). FER was assessed using a computer-based task called Tool for Recognition of Emotions in Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TRENDS). Simultaneously, the corresponding PNHC was recorded with fNIRS. Kruskal Wallis H test was used to analyze between-group differences and Spearman's rho for correlation analysis. Results: The three groups were comparable on socio-demographics (all p>0.09) except education (p = 0.03). HR group had the most hyper-activation in the bilateral DLPFC during the TRENDS task (all p<0.05). There was no significant between-group differences in the FER performance and no significant correlation between the FER performance and the PNHC in the HR and BD groups (all p>0.35). Limitations: The potential confounding effect of medications in the BD group. Conclusions: The hyper-activation of the DLPCF in HR group during FER could indicate an increased risk for BD. However, the lack of similar findings in the BD group might reflect a possible normalizing effect of medications. It is equally likely that differences in the PNHC are detectable earlier than the differences in FER task performance during the course of the illness. This requires further exploration. © 2021",At risk for bipolar disorder; Endophenotype; Facial emotion recognition; Functional near infra-red spectroscopy,"Dept. of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India",English

The steady-state measurement indicates that the presence of microenvironment can greatly affect the tautomeric structure of morin and also Morin property in microenvironment depends upon the amount of oil and Morin concentration. The increase in dipole moment from the ground state to excited state in microenvironment indicate the change in the molecular structure on morin. Morin does not show any nonlinear absorption property but the nonlinear refractive index is observed as a function of Morin concentration as well as MFD values which are due to the thermal agitation of formed dimers.

"Kadam S., Vaidya V.",Cognitive Evaluation of Machine Learning Agents,2021,Cognitive Systems Research,"Advances in applying statistical Machine Learning (ML) led to several claims of human-level or near-human performance in tasks such as image classification & speech recognition. Such claims are unscientific primarily for two reasons, (1) They incorrectly enforce the notion that task-specific performance can be treated as manifestation of General Intelligence and (2) They are not verifiable as currently there is no set benchmark for measuring human-like cognition in a machine learning agent. Moreover, ML agent's performance is influenced by knowledge ingested in it by its human designers. Therefore, agent's performance may not necessarily reflect its true cognition. In this paper, we propose a framework that draws parallels from human cognition to measure machine's cognition. Human cognitive learning is quite well studied in developmental psychology with frameworks and metrics in place to measure actual learning. To either believe or refute the claims of human-level performance of machine learning agent, we need scientific methodology to measure its cognition. Our framework formalizes incremental implementation of human-like cognitive processes in ML agents with an implicit goal to measure it. The framework offers guiding principles for measuring, (1) Task-specific machine cognition and (2) General machine cognition that spans across tasks. The framework also provides guidelines for building domain-specific task taxonomies to cognitively profile tasks. We demonstrate application of the framework with a case study where two ML agents that perform Vision and NLP tasks are cognitively evaluated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cognition Framework; Cognition Metrics; Cognitive Evaluation; Evaluation Metrics; Machine Cognition; Machine Learning,"Department of Technology, SPPU, Pune, India",English
"Karandikar S., Kapoor H., Litman J.",Why so curious? Validation and cross-cultural investigation of the Hindi Epistemic Curiosity Scale,2021,Asian Journal of Social Psychology,"Epistemic curiosity (EC) is the motive and need to seek knowledge. The present work entails validation of the English EC Scale translated into the Hindi language. Study 1 comprised confirmatory factor analysis of the Hindi scale using a sample of 223 bilingual Indians (143 females). The 10-item two-factor structure with Interest and Deprivation subscales was validated for the Hindi EC Scale. Convergent and discriminant validity was established, and model fits were assessed separately for males and females, along with measurement invariance testing. In Study 2, linguistic invariance testing and cross-cultural comparisons were undertaken for a sample of 151 Indians (93 females) and 219 Americans (179 females) for the EC scales, to assess similarities in the underlying factor structure. Indians did not differ from Americans in their responses to the English EC Scale, but slight differences were observed for the Hindi EC Scale, suggesting an interplay of language and culture. Further, independent t tests compared the two samples on measures of curiosity, gossip, personality, and affect. Americans had a higher tendency toward interpersonal curiosity and agreeableness whereas Indians scored higher on intellect. Cross-cultural and linguistic differences as well as future work are presented.

Based on the available evidence and on public health considerations, WHO classified chronic irritability within oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in ICD-11, a solution markedly different from DSM-5’s (i.e. the new childhood mood diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [DMDD]) and from ICD-10’s (i.e. ODD as one of several conduct disorders without attention to irritability). In this study, we tested the accuracy with which a global, multilingual, multidisciplinary sample of clinicians were able to use the ICD-11 classification of chronic irritability and oppositionality as compared to the ICD-10 and DSM-5 approaches. Methods: Clinicians (N = 196) from 48 countries participated in an Internet-based field study in English, Spanish, or Japanese and were randomized to review and use one of the three diagnostic systems. Through experimental manipulation of validated clinical vignettes, we evaluated how well clinicians in each condition could identify chronic irritability versus nonirritable oppositionality, episodic bipolar disorder, dysthymic depression, and normative irritability. Results: Compared to ICD-10 and DSM-5, ICD-11 led to more accurate identification of severe irritability and better differentiation from boundary presentations. Participants using DSM-5 largely failed to apply the DMDD diagnosis when it was appropriate, and they more often applied psychopathological diagnoses to developmentally normative irritability. Conclusions: The formulation of irritability and oppositionality put forth in ICD-11 shows evidence of clinical utility, supporting accurate diagnosis. Global mental health clinicians can readily identify ODD both with and without chronic irritability. © 2020 The World Health Organization",child and adolescent mental health; International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11); irritability; mood dysregulation; oppositional defiant disorder,"Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Clinical Child Psychology Program, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States; Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, United States; Behavioral Health Services and Policy Research, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, New York, NY, United States; National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muñiz, Mexico City, Mexico; Department of Psychology, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, United States; Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, United States; Research Group Epidemiology and Diagnosis in Developmental Psychopathology, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, United States; Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, Tokyo, Japan; Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Autonomous University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Department of Psychiatry, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon; Alekseev Mental Health Clinic No. 1, Moscow, Russian Federation; Department of Psychiatry, ll India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland",English
"Mogaji E., Balakrishnan J., Kieu T.A.",Examining consumer behaviour in the UK Energy sector through the sentimental and thematic analysis of tweets,2021,Journal of Consumer Behaviour,"Consumer engagement with brands on social media has been empirically proven. However, little is known about consumers' natural behaviour on social media, as literature on this topic is still in an early stage of its evolution. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate and understand the group interactions of consumer behaviour, with a specific focus on tweets within the UK energy sector. Energy is a significant utility in the United Kingdom, and the sector is evolving more rapidly than ever before, with pressure being applied to energy suppliers to meet the demands of consumers. This study draws on social capital theory to investigate how UK consumers engage with their suppliers, as well as the knowledge-sharing capabilities of the Twitter community. In Study 1, Python was used to conduct tweet mining and sentiment analysis to investigate the polarity in consumer engagement with 82 energy companies in the United Kingdom. Results indicated overall positive sentiments towards the energy suppliers, although the level of engagement varies across the different groups of suppliers. Study 2 followed up with a qualitative insight into the factors shaping consumers' behaviour as they engage with brands on social media. A thematic model emerges in the form of an interrelated conceptual theory comprising three stakeholders, the key relationships between them, and their natural behaviours. This study offers a contemporary, essential, and interconnected understanding of consumer behaviour online with a focus on the energy sector, and further advances research into online consumer behaviour, sentiment analysis, netnography, and social media research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"Department of Marketing, Events and Tourism, University of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom; Department of Management, Central University of Tamil NaduTamil Nadu, India; Department of Research Administration—International Relations, University of Economics and Finance, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam",English
"Chitra T., Karunanidhi S.","The Impact of Resilience Training on Occupational Stress, Resilience, Job Satisfaction, and Psychological Well-being of Female Police Officers",2021,Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology,"Despite many studies on police stress, there is little research on interventions to promote their well-being. Moreover, most studies of police stress have been predominately on male samples, with female police officers often being neglected. On this premise, the purpose of the present study was to develop and determine the efficacy of resilience training program by evaluating its impact on occupational stress, resilience, job satisfaction, and psychological well-being. Two hundred and fifty female police officers from the Southern part of India were recruited for the study. The study adopted a pre-post-follow-up research design. Resilience training with components such as self-awareness, positive attitude, emotional management, and interpersonal skills were developed uniquely for this study, based on protective model of resilience. Sixty-three female police officers, who fulfilled the criteria, were randomly assigned into two groups namely, experimental (n = 33) and control group (n = 30). Resilience training was given to the experimental group thrice a week for nearly 2 months, and control group was not given any training. Data were collected at three time periods, i.e., before training, a week after training, and 2 months after training. The statistical analysis, using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was carried out. The results revealed that resilience training was effective in enhancing resilience, job satisfaction, and psychological well-being of female police officers and in reducing occupational stress. Medium effect sizes were reported. The qualitative feedback was positive regarding the resilience training program, supporting the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of resilience training program. The study had implications for theory and practice in police research. © 2018, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.",Female police officers; Psychological well-being; RCT; Resilience training; Stress,"Manas—A Pursuit of happiness, 105A/23A, Sivan Koil Street, Kodambakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  600024, India; Department of Psychology, University of Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  600005, India",English

Design: A correlational design was employed through which self-esteem, self-compassion, and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being were measured. Methods: One hundred thirty-four male (M = 25.11, SD = 1.66) and 138 female (M = 21.89, SD = 1.87) participants were chosen by a convenient sampling. Results: The findings evinced that there were significant positive correlations among self-esteem, positive self-compassion, and hedonic and eudaimonic well-being while negative self-compassion exhibited small positive correlations with both the well-being measures (criterion). The regression analyses showed that self-esteem and positive self-compassion reflected significant predictive strengths for hedonic as well as eudaimonic well-being while negative self-compassion did not. This was also true for the social and psychological aspects of well-being. The β values reflected that positive self-compassion did show a higher contribution for both the well-being measures as compared to self-esteem. Conclusions: The findings evinced that positive, not negative, self-compassion mediated the relationship between self-esteem and hedonic well-being as well as self-esteem and eudaimonic well-being. Moreover, self-esteem and self-compassion have predictive strengths for both kinds of well-being. The findings showed the relevance of self-esteem and self-compassion to underscore well-being. The implications and directions for future researchers have been discussed. Practitioner points: Contrary to the earlier findings suggesting self-esteem and self-compassion carrying relevance to explicate performance and well-being of people with individualistic and collectivistic cultures, respectively, the findings of this study suggest both the constructs to be useful to understand the well-being of people with both the values belonging especially to the fast-changing societies like India. The study also suggests reconceptualization and empirical verification of self-compassion that will make it more effective for enhancing and promoting interventions for positive life outcomes. © 2019 British Psychological Society",eudaimonic well-being; hedonic well-being; mediation analysis; negative self-compassion; positive self-compassion; self-esteem,"Department of Psychology, School of Humanities & Social Sciences, Doctor Harisingh Gour Vishwavidyalaya, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, India",English
"Chatterjee S.S., Chakrabarty M., Banerjee D., Grover S., Chatterjee S.S., Dan U.","Stress, Sleep and Psychological Impact in Healthcare Workers During the Early Phase of COVID-19 in India: A Factor Analysis",2021,Frontiers in Psychology,"Background: Risks to healthcare workers have escalated during the pandemic and they are likely to experience a greater level of stress. This cross-sectional study investigated mental distress among healthcare workers during the early phase of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in India. Method: 140 healthcare workers of a tertiary care hospital in India were assessed for perceived stress and insomnia. A factor analysis with principal component method reduced these questions to four components which were categorized as insomnia, stress-related anxiety, stress-related irritability, and stress-related hopelessness. Further statistical analyses were done on these factor scores to identify the predictors and investigate the differences between the different categories of healthcare workers. Result: Doctors had the highest level of anxiety among the healthcare workers. Both doctors and nurses perceived a greater level of irritability than the other HCWs. Compared to doctors and nurses, other HCWs were more likely to experience insomnia. Lower age, higher education, female gender, and urban habitat were associated with greater perception of anxiety. Older age, being quarantined, and single marital status were the significant predictors of irritability. Female gender, single marital-status, and higher number of medical ailments contributed to perceived hopelessness. Quarantine significantly predicted insomnia. Conclusion: Different categories of healthcare workers are experiencing varied mental health problems owing to their heterogeneous socio-demographic backgrounds. Tailored and personalized care, as well as policies, might help in alleviating their problems. Further research is warranted to explore the psychological distress and remedies among these frontline workers during and after the ongoing pandemic crisis. © Copyright © 2021 Chatterjee, Chakrabarty, Banerjee, Grover, Chatterjee and Dan.",COVID-19; healthcare workers; perceived stress; physicians; psychological wellbeing; sleep,"Department of Psychiatry, Diamond Harbour Government Medical College and Hospital (DHGMC), Diamond Harbour, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Department of Psychiatry, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India; Department of Microbiology and In-charge, COVID Testing Unit, Diamond Harbour Government Medical College and Hospital (DHGMC), Diamond Harbour, India; Department of Anatomy and Principal, Diamond Harbour Government Medical College and Hospital (DHGMC), Diamond Harbour, India",English
"Srivastava S., Bajpai L.",Linking conservation of resource perspective to personal growth initiative and intention to leave: role of mediating variables,2021,Personnel Review,"Purpose: The present study intends to explore the underlying mechanism of the effect of personal growth initiative on employee engagement and intention to leave, in the presence of openness to experience and neuroticism as mediating variables. Support from conservation of resource theory and action regulation theory were taken to study the variables. Design/methodology/approach: A time span of four months was taken to collect data from 382 employees belonging to hotel industry of Delhi NCR region of India. Structure equation model and mediation analysis were used in the present study. Findings: A positive association was found between personal growth initiative, engagement and openness to experience and a negative association was found between personal growth initiative, engagement, neuroticism and intention to leave. Openness to experience and neuroticism acted as partial mediators. Research limitations/implications: The researchers have collected the data only from service sector organizations. Hence, there is scope for a cross sectional, longitudinal and experimental intervention–based study to generalize the findings of the study. We also suggest to check the mediating effect of other constructs on the different aspects of well-being of employees at the workplace. Apart from it, if personal growth initiative among employees has a causal role to play for different outcomes, a meta-analysis based on the antecedents and consequences of personal growth initiative would be beneficial. It would further reveal many more insights and possible research themes. Practical implications: Our results present significant practical implication for professionals engaged in day-to-day corporate affairs. As the managers at the workplace around the globe get heavily involved in decision making, and they are prone to observe negative information than the positive set of information, in the presence of both. Social implications: With the help of the study, society can be better conscious of literature related to personality, PGI and its outcome. This way, prospective professionals can understand the significance of personality along with PGI and harness their character accordingly. This would further contribute to prepare young professionals and also fill the supply demand skill gap in the industry and society at large. Any type of imbalance would harm the sustainability of the employment cycle in society. Originality/value: Due to limited literature available in management research on the topic, the researchers of the presented study selected personal initiative as the foundation of personal growth initiative. It has been seen that despite extensive work and interest of researchers, there is a difference in the concept and practice of employee turnover intentions. It is believed that research on human physiology and psychology affect the understanding about organizational research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Employee engagement; India; Intention to leave; Neuroticism; Openness to experience; Personal growth initiative,"Department of OB/HR, Jaipuria Institute of Management, Noida, India; Department of Rural Management, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, India",English

This study examines the status of children living in the households, whose parents or either of the parents was not alive by considering their living arrangement, educational performance, and nutritional status. Orphans are mainly of three types classified by UNICEF as paternal orphans (absence of the father), maternal orphans (absence of mother), and double orphans (absence of both the parents). This study has done the comparative analysis between the orphans and non-orphans by considering their educational performances and nutritional status. The study used the data provided by the National Family Health Survey, India, 2015–16. This survey is a large scale sample survey conducted in households throughout the nation. Based on the data provided by the survey, in the age group 0 to 18 years there were 5 percent orphans (including all three types of orphans) living in the households. Living arrangement of orphans indicated that paternal and maternal orphans were found to be living with either of their alive parents, followed by grandparents, whereas double orphans were living with their extended family members or grandparents. Educational performances were compared for both the types of children and it was found that children who never attended school and the school dropout rates, both were higher among the orphans compared to non-orphans. In terms of nutritional status orphans were lagging behind the non-orphans, in all three indicators, i.e. stunting, wasting and underweight. Thus focused interventions are required for the betterment and welfare of orphans living within the households as the demise of either of the parent creates a void in the early years of life which ultimately affects the child's overall development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Children; Educational performances; Households; India; Nutritional status; Orphans; School dropouts,"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India; International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India",English

In low-income countries, a very little is known about the caregivers who work in child care institutions and play a significant role in the lives of institutionalised children. The study aims to unravel the role of the institutional care system through in-depth semi structured interviews with 20 caregivers working in four different child care institutions in two regions of Northern India. The present study found out that due to poverty, lack of access to education and other basic necessities, children in care have better opportunities for their future than living with their biological parents.

Though a prefrontal cortex (PFC) abnormality is recognised to contribute to WM impairment, the exact nature of its neurobiological basis in SCZ is not well established. Functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging low-cost neuroimaging tool to study neuro-hemodynamics. In this background, we examined the hemodynamic activity during a WM task in schizophrenia using fNIRS. fNIRS was acquired during computerised N-back (zero-, one- & two-back) task in 15 SCZ patients and compared with 22 healthy controls. Performance in N-back test were calculated using signal detection theory alongside the mean reaction times. Concentration and latencies of oxy-, deoxy-, and totalhaemoglobin, and oxygen saturation were computed from 8*8 optodes positioned over bilateral PFC. SCZ performed poorly as measured by most of the WM parameters (p < 0.05). Lesser deoxyhemoglobin concentration (two > zero, at right BA10, p = 0.006) was noted in the right frontopolar cortex in SCZ surviving multiple-comparison correction. In addition, olanzapine equivalent doses correlated negatively with right frontopolar cortex activation (two > zero back, BA10, ρ = 0.70, p = 0.004) and better performance in two back (false alarm rate, ρ = 0.61, p = 0.015). A delayed but compensatory hyperactivation of right frontopolar cortex noted in SCZ may underlie the WM deficit in SCZ. Future studies are recommended to replicate the role of right frontopolar cortex in WM using larger samples and systematically explore the effect of antipsychotics on them. © 2020",fNIRS; N-back test; Neurocognition; PFC; Schizophrenia; Working memory,"InSTAR Program, Schizophrenia Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of mental health and neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India",English

Professionals and researchers are also paying increasing attention to Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and big data, as well as Circular Economy (CE) concepts, due to the many advantages they can provide for the manufacturing industry. The purpose of the CE is the effective utilization of resources, and the I4.0 concept has been established to help achieve this objective and requires further exploration in the field of sustainable production. Research gaps exist in the literature regarding challenges to I4.0 and CE in terms of Sustainable Footwear Production (SFP) in emerging economies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to deliver an original analysis of the most significant challenges regarding the interaction of I4.0 and CE for SFP. A comprehensive literature review is performed to establish the challenges to I4.0-CE for SFP in the context of emerging economies. Further, the challenges identified are prioritized based on the assessment of a real case study from the footwear industry. A mixed methodology (i.e., both qualitative and quantitative) is adopted to identify the cause-effect interactions among the identified challenges. The results of our analysis show that the five most important causal challenges obstructing the execution of SFP in the footwear industry are ‘deficient legislative-industry strategies towards SFP adoption’, ‘lack of competence in I4.0 and CE concepts for SFP adoption’, ‘understanding of synchronization among suppliers for attaining SFP’, ‘uncertain economic benefits of I4.0 and CE application for attaining SFP’ and ‘inadequate support for industries towards SFP efforts’. This study may be beneficial for industry managers, practitioners and decision makers to establish an understanding of I4.0-CE initiatives and to mitigate the most significant challenges regarding the successful implementation of I4.0-CE for SFP. © 2021",Big data; Circular economy; Green recovery; Industry 4.0; Sustainable Development Goals; Sustainable production,"O P Jindal Global University, Jindal Global Business School, Sonipat, 131001, India; Institute of Leather Engineering and Technology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, 1209, Bangladesh; Emlyon Business School, Ecully, LN6 7TS, France; FIA Business School, Sao Paulo, Brazil",English

"Ojha P., Verma K., Kashyap N.",Does learning styles influence false memory generation?,2021,Psychological Thought,"Human memory has been studied for several years. But due to its complex nature, the quest to understand properties/processes associated with it never fades. It has many properties, and one of them is its reconstructive nature. The vulnerability of false memories is not only dependent on exogenous factors (for example deep processing, retention intervals, list items, characteristics). Instead, it is also reliant on endogenous factors (for example age, emotions, mood state, arousal level), as well as with some personality factors. This study explores the idea that personality learning styles viz. field-independent and field-dependent influence the formation of false memory on the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The study reports that on recall test, field-dependent learners identify more critical lures as compared to filed independent learners.

Moreover, OSA and insomnia can also be comorbid. This study aims at finding the proportion of SSM and “Comorbid Insomnia with OSA” (COMISA) among patients of OSA and chronic insomnia. Macroachitecture of sleep was also compared across groups. Methods: This study utilized the retrospective laboratory and medical records of two groups of patients: chronic insomnia and OSA. Sleep disorders were diagnosed according to standard criteria. Daytime sleepiness was examined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Diagnosis of SSM was based on the difference between subjective and objective sleep onset latency (Subjective SOL > 1.5 × Objective SOL). Results: Sixteen adult subjects were included in each group. Based on the difference between subjective and objective sleep onset latency, SSM was reported by 62.5% subjects of chronic insomnia and 56.25% subjects having OSA (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 0.31–5.33; P = 0.79). The proportion of COMISA in subjects with chronic insomnia was 18% and among subjects with OSA, it was 43%. Effect size for the proportion was calculated as odds ratio (33.96; 95% CI = 7.48–154.01; P < 0.0002). Thus, the odds for COMISA were higher among subjects with OSA than those with chronic Insomnia. The three groups (OSA, COMISA and Chronic Insomnia) were comparable with regard to the macro-architecture of sleep. Conclusion: SSM is common among subjects with OSA and chronic insomnia.

Knowledge of caregiver's perceptions and needs, within their social and cultural context, forms the basis for effective health care partnerships with families. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions about FCC among caregivers of children with cerebral palsy (CP) in South India. Method: Fourteen caregivers of children with CP (aged 4–12 years) living in rural areas of the coastal region of Karnataka, India, participated in this qualitative study. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis using the framework and hybrid approaches. Thematic mapping of the categories and themes was done to explore relationships about perceptions of FCC. Results: Caregiver's life emerged inductively as a new theme highlighting caregiver's own physical and mental health, family roles and well-being, integrating the onus of care with household responsibilities, limited participation in personal activities and social isolation. The qualitative findings revealed the ubiquity of respectful and trusting relationships with health professionals while expressing paucity of coordinated comprehensive care, sporadic partnerships and opportunities for shared decision-making; desire for receiving specific information related to child's progress and prognosis; and general information on community resources and the need of empowerment and support groups. Conclusion: Our study has practical implications for the implementation of FCC within the South Indian context, by recognizing unique caregiver needs and expectations in sync with cultural perspectives towards childhood disability such as societal stigma, values and traditional beliefs; attitudes towards medical professionals; and life stressors and gender responsibilities. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",childhood disability; coordinated services; health information; maternal well-being; parent participation; partnership,"Department of Physiotherapy, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India; Department of Medicine, Dr TMA Pai Hospital, Udupi, Karnataka, India; Melaka Manipal Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India; Enabling Inclusion Program, Amar Seva Sangam, Ayikudi, Tamil Nadu, India; Rehabilitative Services, Prince County Hospital, Summerside, PE, Canada; Department of Physiotherapy, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India",English
"Cui L., Shao X., Mago B., Ravi R.V.",Digital intangible cultural heritage management using deep learning models,2021,Aggression and Violent Behavior,"Digital techniques have been used to record cultural heritage with high-quality imagery and documentation. However, some historical properties are completely or partially labeled, and some are externally impaired, which reduces their attraction and causes loss of value. Classification of images is one of the most significant digital-era tasks. As for cultural heritage, classification processes must be developed well and less computer-intensive because image classification typically requires huge data. In this article, Deep Learning assisted Intangible Cultural Heritage Management (DLICHM) has been proposed based on digital tools. A deep learning model automatically analyzes damaged images at the computing terminal based on the gathered data. This approach focuses on the automated annotation and completion of metadata by new deep learning and annotation approaches. It tackles visually damaged objects through a novel approach to image reconstruction focused on supervised and unsupervised learning. The findings suggest that deep learning provides an adequate solution to the semantic annotation of shared cultural heritage data. © 2021",Deep learning; Digital; Image classification; Intangible cultural heritage management,"School of Marxism, Tongling University, Tongling, Anhui  244000, China; Computer Science Department, Skyline University College, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, M.E.A Engineering College, Malappuram, Kerala, India",English
"Mahajan R., Mahajan R., Sharma E., Mansotra V.",“Are we tweeting our real selves?” personality prediction of Indian Twitter users using deep learning ensemble model,2021,Computers in Human Behavior,"Social Networking Sites have significant potential to reveal valuable explicit as well as implicit statistics and patterns when deep learning is applied to their raw and unstructured data. Tweets posted by the users on their timeline not only reflect their mindset, their likes and dislikes but could also be used to unveil significant amount of information about many psychological aspects and behavior that may be hard to study directly. This paper aims to predict the personality of the 100 real-time Twitter users conforming to personality traits in the BIG 5 model by extracting features from their tweets using ensemble of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Memory). The findings of our experiment shows that our model performs slightly better than previous baselines methods achieving an accuracy 75.134% on testing data. We have further hypothesized that unrestricted data available on Twitter may contain features that can be used to predict the personality of its user. It was concluded that personality of Twitter users in the real world is reflected in their online behaviour, reinforcing the premise that the nature of online interactions does not significantly differ from that of real-world interactions. Overall, the study provides a deep insight into the impact of social media data in providing predictive indicators of user behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",BiLSTM; Deep learning; Personality; Social networking sites; Twitter,"Department of Computer Science and IT, University of Jammu, J&K, India; Department of Psychology, University of Jammu, India",English
"Gomes J., Almeida S.C., Kaveri G., Mannan F., Gupta P., Hu A., Sarkar M.",Early Childhood Educators as COVID Warriors: Adaptations and Responsiveness to the Pandemic Across Five Countries,2021,International Journal of Early Childhood,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted countries across the globe. The pandemic has created a completely new teaching–learning environment of interaction for early childhood educators. In many countries, face-to-face teaching has been replaced by remote teaching, while in others, there have been intermittent lockdowns and limited interruptions to regular teaching norms. Given the play-based nature of preschool teaching–learning activities in most countries, educators are required to reimagine the sociocultural relationships to their pedagogical practices in their everyday teaching–learning contexts. This paper sheds light on educators’ experiences and the dramatic shift in their indoor–outdoor teaching–learning environment due to the evolving health measures. The study draws on notions of teachers’ identities and Vygotsky’s cultural–historical concept of social situation of development (Vygotsky, 1994) to capture the new forms of relationships that early childhood educators experienced with their pedagogical environments across different countries during the pandemic. Data were collected from preschool teachers across five countries—Australia, Bangladesh, Norway, Singapore and India using online surveys which included open- and close-ended questions. Findings reveal the on-ground realities and teachers’ adaptations to new pedagogies emerging across the five countries. The new digital environments provided an equally new dimension for change. These changes were seen in interactions, relationships within the everyday pedagogical contexts, as well as the shifting physical and social environment of early years educators. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",COVID-19; Cultural–Historical Theory; Early childhood; Social Situation of Development; Teacher Identity,"Faculty of Education, Monash University Australia, Clayton, VIC  3800, Australia; Early Childhood Education, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Singapore, 599494, Singapore; Shoishob, Early Childhood Parental Group, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Ambedkar University, Delhi, India; Department of Pedagogy, Religion and Social Studies, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), Bergen, Norway; Monash Centre for Scholarship in Health Education (MCSHE), Monash University Australia, Clayton, VIC  3800, Australia",English
"Mohammed Z., Kumar S., Padakannaya P.",Well-being and Career Decision-making Difficulties Among Master’s Students: A Simultaneous Multi-Equation Modeling,2021,Cogent Psychology,"There is a stellar upsurge in the number of persons pursuing a master’s level of education as well as the institutions offering it in the current generation. Nevertheless, an explicit theoretical and empirical implication of how the tutelages, at this level, shape the well-being of learners—such that it could help individuals overcome career decision-making difficulties remains to be elucidated. The present study addressed two major objectives. Firstly, we investigated the well-being of master’s degree students along with career decision-making difficulties in India. Secondly, apart from exploring the possible influence of nationality of the respondents on career decision difficulty, the study expanded the literature on career decision-making difficulties to under-researched populations in developing countries. Through a cross-sectional research design, we recruited a sample of 136 master’s degree respondents. The result reveals that while the composite well-being resources significantly influenced Career Decision Difficulties, the nationality of respondents appeared not as a germane factor in this context. Following the evaluation of the direct effect of individual well-being resources; Self-acceptance and Personal growth proved to have a statistically significant effect on career decision-making difficulties. Also, among the constituents of career decision-making difficulties studied, lack of readiness appears to be the major concern among the respondents. The findings expand the literature on cognitive, vocational, and organization science vis-a-vis career decision-making difficulties and provide useful insights for educational institutions and practitioners. © 2021 The Author(s).

An Analysis of Data From 156 Countries,2021,Journal of Attention Disorders,"Objective: To examine the relationship between nation-level prevalence of ADHD and COVID-19 prevalence and mortality indices. Method: Associations between nation-wise estimated prevalence, crude mortality rates and case-fatality ratios for COVID-19 and estimated prevalence rates for ADHD were examined, controlling for medical conditions known to be associated with COVID-19 outcome, as well as demographic, climate-related, and economic variables. Results: Prevalence of ADHD was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence and crude mortality rates on bivariate analyses, though the strength of this association was low. On multivariate regression, prevalence of ADHD was negatively associated with COVID-19 prevalence and crude mortality rates, though only the former finding was statistically significant. Conclusion: The association between ADHD and COVID-19 prevalence and mortality at a national level is inconsistent, modest, and may be largely due to confounding factors such as age, lifestyle factors, and medical comorbidities. © ©The Author(s) 2021.",ADHD; comorbidity; COVID-19; crude mortality rate; prevalence,"Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry, India",English
"Aslinger E.N., Lane S.P., Lynam D.R., Trull T.J.",The Influence of Narcissistic Vulnerability and Grandiosity on Momentary Hostility Leading up to and Following Interpersonal Rejection,2021,"Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment","Wide empirical support exists for 2 aspects of narcissism—grandiosity and vulnerability. Hostility is a form of interpersonal antagonism, which is considered central to narcissism broadly. Though it has often been subsumed by the concept of narcissistic grandiosity, interpersonal antagonism is associated with vulnerability as well. Rejection represents an interpersonal stressor that evokes hostility to a greater degree in those high in narcissism, with mixed evidence regarding whether it stems from threat to one’s egotism (grandiosity) or low self-esteem (vulnerability). Therefore, investigating the associations between narcissistic dimensions and individuals’ trajectories of hostility leading up to and following rejection may provide a basis for a more unified conceptualization. In this study, we leverage the wide range of narcissistic expression displayed in a combined sample of borderline personality disorder (N = 56) and community (N = 60) individuals who completed ambulatory assessments approximately 6 times per day for 21 consecutive days. We examine whether narcissistic vulnerability and grandiosity, as measured by NEO Personality Inventory facet combinations constructed based on the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory, moderate trajectories and overall levels of hostility surrounding self-reported interpersonal rejections. Grandiosity and vulnerability were independently positively associated with a faster rise in hostility leading up to rejection; however, greater grandiosity was uniquely associated with a greater spike in hostility at the occasion of rejection and subsequent faster recovery. These results are consistent with both the idea that grandiosity is proportionately more central to interpersonal antagonism and that antagonism serves as a bridge, connecting and reinforcing both narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability. © 2021 American Psychological Association",grandiosity; hostility; narcissism; rejection; vulnerability,"Department of Psychological Sciences, Purdue University, India; Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri, United States",English

The sociodemographic factors influencing these outcomes were also examined. Method: A prospective, cross-sectional study of 130 infertile couples over 1 year at a tertiary level teaching hospital. Couples were requested to complete the WHOQOLBREF instrument and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Data was analyzed using paired t test, 1-way multivariate linear variance analysis, and regression, and correlation models. Results: Mean QOL scores between men and women showed a strong agreement within psychological, social, environmental, and physical domains (r =.70,.67,.69, and.59 likewise). The presence of depressive symptoms was associated with significantly impaired QOL scores through all domains. Depression was present in 30.6% of female partners and 27.2% in male partners. Pearson correlation between female partner BDI scores and male partner scores was highly statistically significant with a correlation coefficient of.745. The presence of depression was not found to be significantly associated with sociodemographic and clinical parameters. Conclusions: QOL and depression scores of 1 partner were reflected in the scores of the other partner. Henceforth, screening and psychoeducation should be couple based considering the couple as 1 unit which is likely to improve the mental wellbeing of the couple. The presence of depression is not influenced by the sociodemographic profile of couples therefore all infertile couples should be screened and offered counseling. © 2021 American Psychological Association",Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); depression; infertile couples; quality of life; WHOQOL-BREF,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India; Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India",English
"Mondal M., Dua B., Duggal C.",A Path of Opportunity and Challenge: Perspectives of Psychotherapy Supervisors in India,2021,Psychological Studies,"Supervision serves the critical function of fostering professional growth and competence among psychotherapists all over the world. Despite the pivotal role that supervisors play in promoting therapist development and ensuring client well-being, there has been a major gap in the literature on supervision practice in India. The present study set out to understand the professional development of supervisors, and explore the nature and process of supervision provided, and the relationship between supervisors and supervisees from the perspectives of supervisors in the Indian context. A mixed methods study was conceptualized and twenty practicing psychotherapy supervisors completed a questionnaire designed for the purpose of the study. Quantitative and qualitative data from the questionnaire was analyzed using the concurrent triangulation strategy. Results indicated that supervisors in India practiced in a variety of settings and catered to mostly trainees and novices. A majority were mandated to adopt the role of a supervisor, felt ill-prepared as they had no formal training in supervision, and tended to rely on their own prior supervision experiences to guide them. Supervisors concurrently balanced multiple roles like teacher, mentor, counselor and rated various tasks of supervision as important to the process. Supervisors also experienced ethical dilemmas, value conflicts and crisis situations in their practice. The supervisory relationship was dynamic and changed with the growth and development of the supervisee. The experience of stagnation, disillusionment and decline was shared by some supervisors. Findings reveal the need to create reflective spaces, training and support for psychotherapy supervisors.

In turn, sexual health is a major domain within broader sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), both in its own right as a human right, and owing to the importance of good sexual health for ensuring good reproductive outcomes. Furthermore, SRHR is a necessary, core part of overall health, thus sexual health and wellbeing is a fundamental aspect of general health that is often overlooked or even denied for some. In this commentary, we utilize a life course approach to illustrate how the tripartite of sexual health, rights and pleasure manifest themselves with different interlocking linkages, and actively contribute to overall health throughout life.

The purpose of this study was to test Sleep Displacement and Psychological Arousal theories of CPU-led sleep disruption in relation in a sample of university students. CPU for unstructured leisure activities before sleep (CPU_BeforeBed), as well as CPU for accessing explicit or emotionally charged media content before sleep (CPU_Arousal), were both measured. 525 (75% female) undergraduate students from a large public institution participated in this study during fall 2019. The data were collected using a battery of validated self-report questionnaires. Questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, which was used to measure sleep latency and sleep difficulty, and a contemporary questionnaire developed to measure CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal. A crude odds ratio analysis was implemented to analyze findings. Sleep Displacement data showed higher odds of sleep latency occurring with CPU_BeforeBed [Exp (B) = 1.091, p < 0.001]. Psychological Arousal data showed higher odds of sleep difficulty occurring with CPU_Arousal [Exp (B) = 1.065, p < 0.001]. CPU_BeforeBed significantly predicted sleep latency [Exp (B) = 1.062, p < 0.01], and CPU_Arousal significantly predicted the sleep difficulty [Exp (B) = 1.069, p < 0.001] of undergraduate students. Young adults who used cell phones before sleep and access emotionally charged content before going to bed were more likely to report trouble sleeping. They took more time to fall asleep at night as their sleep hours were compressed due to CPU. These findings support the Sleep Displacement and Arousal theories of sleep disruption and provide further insight into possible mechanisms for sleep disturbance in young adults. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japanese Society of Sleep Research.",Arousal effects; Nighttime cell phone use; Sleep difficulty; Sleep latency; Young adults,"Department of Educational Psychology, Texas A&M University, 718B Harrington Tower, College Station, TX  77843-4225, United States; Jindal School of Psychology & Counselling, O.

This paper aims to develop an expansive understanding of equanimity as a distinct psychological construct. Thirty experts from various traditions such as Buddhism, Vedic studies, meditation, and yoga were interviewed on their understanding and insights into equanimity. The findings suggest equanimity as an even-mindedness towards the varied hedonic and affective experiences. The cognitive, affective, and conative mechanisms of equanimity such as increased distress tolerance, hedonic neutrality, and reduced reactivity are outlined. At the interpersonal level, equanimity entails impartiality and reduced bias towards others. The challenges one may face during the cultivation of equanimity have been suggested by the experts.

Evidence from Rural Bihar, India",2021,Social Indicators Research,"Does deprivation of assets imply an increased likelihood of vulnerability to climate change? Our study attempts to answer this question by analyzing the multidimensional poverty in rural Bihar, followed by deciphering the link between the developed poverty index and vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. Vulnerability index used in the present study was developed under the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) by the Government of India. As most people in rural areas and those dependent on rural based livelihood activities (such as agriculture, forestry and livestock) are more vulnerable to vagaries of weather, related attributes (i.e. land ownership, livestock ownership as well as access to agriculture equipments) are included in our analysis. We found that the extent of multidimensional poverty in rural Bihar was 0.278 indicating that rural poor were deprived in 27.8 percent of the total potential deprivations that they could experience overall. It varied from 0.19 to 0.39 across districts. The findings highlight that a majority of the population were deprived in living standard dimension, followed by health and education dimensions. Further, the districts where the multidimensional poverty was high were also more vulnerable to climate change. The study advocates for formulation of district specific programs that can target major contributing factors resulting in reducing the extent of multidimensional poverty and vulnerability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Agricultural vulnerability index; Bihar; Climate change; Dimensions; India; Multidimensional poverty,"Division of Dairy Economics, Statistics and Management, ICAR- National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana  132 001, India; ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, Karnal, Haryana  132 001, India; Division of Dairy Extension, ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana  132 001, India",English
"Iqbal N., Dar K.A.",Gratitude Intervention and Subjective Well-Being in Indian Adolescents: Examining the Moderating Effects of Self-Esteem,2021,Child Indicators Research,"In the past decade, positive psychology interventions (PPIs) have been a subject of research focusing on methods for increasing individual’s well-being and happiness. To date, however, the findings are conflicting vis-a-vis the efficacy of these interventions. Thus, a 6-week longitudinal study (N = 385) was designed to examine the immediate and long-term payoffs of practicing specific PPIs, such as counting one’s blessings (CB) and visualizing best possible selves (BPS) in promoting subjective well-being (SWB) in Indian sample. Adolescents performed one of the three exercises for 2-weeks and were asked to continue performing it at home until follow-up (4-weeks). Following extant theory and research, the practices of CB and BPS were expected to boost short-term and long-term SWB, relative to the control condition. Furthermore, we hypothesized that baseline self-esteem would moderate the effects of performing exercise on sustained satisfaction with life (SWL), positive experience (PE), and negative experience (NE) – indicators of SWB. Results supported these hypotheses and suggested that the CB exercise may be the most beneficial for raising and maintaining PE and decreasing NE. The results also revealed that participants with low baseline self-esteem practicing CB exercise experienced the largest increase in SWL over time. Implications of the findings for practice are discussed, and the limitations of the study are reviewed. Moreover, areas that could be further build-up in prospective research are proposed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Gratitude intervention; Life satisfaction; Negative experience; Positive experience; Self-esteem; Subjective well-being,"Department of Psychology, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India; Department of Psychology, Government Degree College, Baramulla, Jammu & Kashmir  193103, India",English

The ensuing mental health issues are not only restricted to the patients and their relatives/friends but affect the healthcare workers (HCWs) as well. Our study aims to assess these psychological trends during the COVID-19 pandemic between the two most affected population groups, that is, patients and frontline healthcare workers. Patients and Methods: A survey questionnaire, including scales to assess fear, anxiety, stress, depression – PSS 10, and DASS 21, was distributed and sent to all COVID-19 suspected/confirmed individuals and healthcare workers at a tertiary care center along with a second visit after 14 days of answering the first questionnaire and this continued as follow-up. Data were analyzed with the SPSS version 23 using various tests of significance. Results: In the community, COVID-19 patients in the age group 41–50 with respiratory tract symptoms and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of mental health problems. Healthcare workers posted in COVID-19 designated areas of the hospital displayed higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: The high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the psychological state of suspected/confirmed cases as well as healthcare workers.

"Roy R.G., Kumar A.",The mediating role of parental playfulness on parent–child relationship and competence among parents of children with ASD,2021,Advances in Autism,"Purpose: The difficulties of a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can lead to behaviours that are quite challenging for parents to understand and address. Most of the parental studies of ASD focus on the challenges faced by the parents. This study aims to adopt a strength-based model that investigates the mediating role of parental playfulness in the association between parent–child relationship and parental competence. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a quantitative study that adopts a correlational research design. The mediation analysis explores the role of parental playfulness as a mediator in the association between parent–child relationship and parental competence. The sample consisted of 120 parents of children diagnosed with ASD from India, selected using a purposive sampling technique. Findings: The mediation analysis results indicate that playfulness among parents of children with ASD was found to function as a partial mediator in the relationship between parent–child relationship and parental competence. This could suggest that more playful parents have better parent–child relationships and are competent in parenting. Research limitations/implications: These findings have importance in understanding the role of playful interaction on parent–child relationships and parenting competence, having implications for further research. Enabling playfulness in parenting will enhance children and parents to promote their relationship and thus feel competent to bring positive light in their lives. Practical implications: Most often, the clinicians are concerned with addressing only the autistic symptoms; it is also essential to look into parental well-being. Practical playful interaction training should help parents establish a rapport, understand, adjust and adapt with their child. Social implications: Practical intervention and training plans can be suggested to all family members to improve the condition of the child and the family’s general well-being. As the study focused on the clinical population, the findings could provide useful inputs for mental health professionals and counsellors. Originality/value: There are some theoretical and empirical evidence that support positive outcomes of playfulness on personal well-being (Atzaba Poria, in press; Yue et al., 2016; Proyer, 2014). Although there has been some interest in the impact of children’s playfulness on their development (Bundy, 1997), little is known about the influence of parental playfulness on parents and children. Therefore, addressing these gaps, this empirical study focusses on investigating the role of parental playfulness in parent–child relationship and parental competence, rather than considering external challenges of parents based on the ASD child’s behavioural challenges and autistic features. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autism spectrum disorder; Child; Parental competence; Parent–child relationship; Playfulness,"Rini Grace Roy and Aneesh Kumar are both based at the Department of Psychology, Christ University, Bangalore, India",English

However, empirical examinations of factors contributing to suicide in India and assessments of reliability and validity of self-report measures assessing these constructs are rare. Aims: The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ). Materials & Methods: Undergraduate students in India (N = 432) completed the INQ and questionnaires assessing suicidal ideation, depression, fearlessness about death, and pain tolerance. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses of the 15-item INQ indicated that after removing three items assessing perceived burdensomeness, the two-factor structure of INQ demonstrated acceptable fit with good internal consistency for each of the subscales (α =.84–.90). In line with the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS), thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness interacted to predict suicidal ideation. Additionally, these constructs were positively associated with suicidal ideation and depression, and weakly correlated with fearlessness about death and pain tolerance. Discussion: Results support the relevance of the IPTS for understanding suicidal ideation among college students in India. Conclusion: The results suggest that modified INQ demonstrates strong internal consistency, as well as good construct, criterion, and discriminant validity among Indian college students. © 2021 The American Association of Suicidology.",culture; INQ; IPTS; suicide,"Department of Psychology, Miami University, Oxford, OH, United States; Department of Psychology, Christ University, Bengaluru, India",English
"Mathai A.T., Rai S., Behere R.V.",Emotional Threat Perception and Its Association with Neurocognition in Social Anxiety Disorder,2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: The negative appraisal of emotional stimuli is a feature of social anxiety disorder (SAD). People with SAD demonstrate deficits in neurocognitive performance while performing tasks of attention. However, the relationship between attentional control, working memory, and threat perception in SAD has not been studied well. The present study aimed to identify patterns of threat perception in relation to performance on attention and visuospatial working memory tasks in individuals with SAD. Methods: Subjects with SAD (n = 27) and a healthy comparative (HC) group (n = 26) completed tasks of sustained and focused attention, visuospatial working memory, computerized emotion identification, and pictorial emotional Stroop. Results: The SAD group had decreased performance in the domains of sustained (P = 0.001) and focused attention (P = 0.04). They also had an enhanced threat perception as demonstrated by greater reaction time to anger (P = 0.03), lower emotion recognition accuracy (P = 0.05), and higher over-identification of the threat to neutral and nonthreatening faces. However, the Stroop effect was not demonstrated across the groups. No group difference was seen in the performance on the visuospatial working memory tasks. Lower focused attention was significantly correlated with higher emotional threat perception (ETP; P = 0.001) in the SAD group. Conclusion: People with SAD have greater deficits in attention processing and ETP. The attention deficits were associated with enhanced ETP in social anxiety. The link between threat perception and cognitive functions would aid in a better understanding of SAD and in planning appropriate intervention. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Attention; Social anxiety disorder; Threat perception; Visuospatial working memory,"Dept. of Clinical Psychology, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India; KEM Hospital Research Center Pune, India",English
"Kuanr A., Pradhan D., Lyngdoh T., Lee M.S.W.",Why do consumers subvert brands? investigating the influence of subjective well-being on brand avoidance,2021,Psychology and Marketing,"Negative consumer–brand interactions often result in consumer subversion, in which consumers actively reject or avoid brands. To date, the role of positive emotional states, such as subjective well-being, in brand avoidance remains a crucial oversight in the literature seeking to address consumer subversion. In this study, comprising three studies, we examine why and when subjective well-being influences brand avoidance. Drawing on self-control theory and the literature related to anti-consumption, we argue and demonstrate in Study 1 (N = 330) that subjective well-being enhances consumers' ability to avoid brands that transgress moral and ethical norms. Study 2 (N = 251) reveals the underlying psychological process by which subjective well-being engenders greater self-control in consumers who, as a response, exhibit brand avoidance behavior. Study 3 (N = 243) indicates that anti-consumption attitude serves as the boundary condition; it specifically demonstrates that a macro-oriented anti-consumption attitude accentuates the influence of subjective well-being on brand avoidance, whereas a micro-oriented anti-consumption attitude does not have any effect. Our research contributes to the consumer subversion literature by evaluating the influence of subjective well-being on moral brand avoidance. This study offers key insights for marketing managers entering markets containing consumers with high or low subjective well-being. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",anti-consumption; brand avoidance; consumer subversion; self-control theory; subjective well-being,"Essex Business School, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, United Kingdom; Xavier School of Management - XLRI, Circuit House Area (East), Jamshedpur, 831001, India; Kent Business School, University of Kent, The Sail and Colour Loft, The Historic Dockyard, Chatham, United Kingdom; University of Auckland Business School, Auckland, New Zealand",English

Human transmission of this disease occurs mainly through droplet inhalation and hence, direct contact with mucous membranes and saliva is considered risky. The study was conducted using a five-point scale PSS10 (Perceived Stress Scale) questionnaire. Comparison between study groups (gender and age group) with continuous variables (PSS score) was done using independent t test. The chi-square test was used to compare the age group and gender with PSS categories; low, moderate and high. The mean PSS score of the respondents was 17.43 ± 6.45 with a range from 2 to 35 with women having higher mean stress scores (18.15 ± 6.54) compared to men (16.46 ± 6.24). Participants aged 40 years and less reported higher PSS scores (18.60 ± 6.40) compared to the older age group (16.14 ± 6.30). Since varying amounts of stress are present in different groups, etiology of perceived stress and measures to control it may be investigated in the future so as to avoid stress-related crisis in the health sector.

Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive and cross-sectional study initiates with reviewing the available literature in the field of employee engagement to identify factors affecting and the corresponding items defining them. Following the discussion with experts and industry professionals, an instrument was, thus, obtained to administer the primary data from employees working in public and private power companies in India. The study used Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) 3 to demonstrate employee engagement as a first-order reflective and second-order formative construct. Thereafter, reliability and convergent validity were assessed to validate the instrument. Findings: This paper conceptualized employee engagement as a multi-factor construct (nine in numbers). The factors are “Respect”, “Supervisor's support and recognition”, “Growth and development”, “Creative and challenging job”, “Job significance”, “Perceived self-worth”, “performance evaluation and recognition” and “Organizational bureaucracy”. These factors are exhaustive and collectively define employee engagement. Distortion or omission in any of these items may distort the nature of construct as well. Originality/value: Previous studies have defined the concept of employee engagement as unidimensional and thus observe serious lacunas. This study identified employee engagement as a multi-factor construct that incorporates the exhaustive nature of the organizational setting.

The present study systematically reviewed the possible factors that are influencing self-care behavior of disadvantaged diabetic patients that contribute heavily to the management of this chronic illness. Structured searches were conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, and manual searches on Google Scholar for articles published between the years 2000 and 2020. The review was limited to a particular time frame due to the change in WHO criteria for diagnosis and classification of abnormal glucose tolerance. Initially, 96858 articles were identified, and following the screening and full-text reading, 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria were chosen for systematic review. Seven studies had reported the factors influencing self-care behavior among disadvantaged diabetic population. Three studies had reported the importance of intervention strategies and its impact on self-care behavior among them. Findings show that self-care management of socio-economically disadvantaged people entails dimensions including diabetes knowledge, lack of physical activities, social support, lack of access to services, life disruptions, denial of illness, societal attitudes, responsibilities, and treatment costs. It was additionally discovered that diabetes self-management support mediations are successful in drawing in lower economy patients, tending to contending life needs and hindrances to self-care, and encouraging behavior change. Taken together, future methodologically efficacious studies that establish health promoting behaviors and explorations of the factors influencing self-care behaviors of disadvantaged diabetic patients are needed. © The Author(s) 2021.",diabetes; self-care; self-care behavior; self-care belief; self-care health belief,"Department of Psychology, Central University of Karnataka of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Kalaburagi, India",English
Narvekar H.N.,A Reflection on the Current Status of Animal-Assisted Therapy in India,2021,Human Arenas,"The field of animal-assisted therapy is advancing quickly throughout the world gaining popularity as a complementary therapy. Several countries, especially in the East, are still in their nascent phase in utilizing animal-assisted therapy and a more realistic presentation of their status should drive them towards effective initiatives to promote the field. The primary objective of this paper is to throw light on the current scenario of animal-assisted therapy in India. The relevant databases such as Scopus, Google Scholar, Proquest, PubMed, and JSTOR were searched to identify the research literature. The organizational websites, news, and blog articles, as well as institutional repositories, were explored to maximize the evidence. A total of 24 articles were found which included published research articles as well as unpublished conference papers. Results found a dearth of practice and research throughout the country indicating an urgent need to direct steps in promoting the growth of the field. The contemporary issues in the implementation of animal-assisted therapy such as cultural and religious beliefs, lack of awareness, lack of practising organizations and therapists warrant immediate attention. Reducing the research and practice gap alongside focusing on creating awareness, changing public perception, introducing coursework in educational institutions, the publication of evidence-based research will help in the acceptance and growth of this novel therapeutic field. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Animal-assisted interventions; Human-animal bond; Mental health; Pet therapy; Review; Therapy dogs,"Department of Psychology, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, 560029, India",English

Furthermore, the study endeavors to test the difference in conceptual model estimates, across two groups of employees: those who work on contract/temporary and permanent basis. The study gains relevance particularly in the context of the emerging sharing economy, where jobs are primarily characterized by short-term contracts and freelancing. Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive study was conducted among a sample of 523 educators working in private educational institutions in India. Self-reporting questionnaires were administered among the respondents, who were selected through the purposive sampling method. Structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis were done to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The analysis revealed that workplace spirituality enriched employee well-being and loyalty toward the organization and evidence were found for indirect effects too. Variances were observed in the relationships, with respect to the different employment statuses of the personnel. Significant differences in the relationships were not found across temporary and permanent employment statuses. Interestingly, temporary employees experienced stronger influences between meaningful work, well-being and word-of-mouth. Results suggest the relevance of understanding employees' differential work experiences and attitudes and thus facilitate human resource strategies accordingly. Originality/value: This study is pioneering in conceptualizing and testing a theoretical model linking workplace spirituality, well-being at work and employee loyalty, particularly in the context of employees who differ in their employment status, which is a critical aspect of modern-day organizations. Unlike traditional workplaces, in recent times, people come together and work along for shorter terms, as the case of a sharing economy and the thus emergent interpersonal dynamics between each other and with the workplace has significant repercussions on the organization.

However, the literature on specific impairments in emotion processing cognitive strategies (directive/cortical/higher versus intuitive/limbic/lower) in euthymic adult BD patients and healthy first-degree relatives/high-risk (HR) subjects in comparison with healthy controls (HCs) is sparse. Methods: We examined facial emotion recognition deficits (FERD) in BD (N = 30), HR (N = 21), and HC (N = 30) matched for age (years), years of education, and sex using computer-administered face emotions–Matching And Labeling Task (eMALT). Results: The three groups were significantly different based on labeling accuracy scores for fear and anger (FA) (P < 0.001) and sad and disgust (SD) (P < 0.001). On post-hoc analysis, HR subjects exhibited a significant deficit in the labeling accuracy of FA facial emotions (P < 0.001) compared to HC. The BD group was found to have significant differences in all FA (P = 0.004) and SD (P = 0.003) emotion matching as well as FA (P = 0.001) and SD (P < 0.001) emotion labeling accuracy scores. Conclusions: BD in remission exhibits FERD in general, whereas specific labeling deficits of fear and anger emotions, indicating impaired directive higher order aspect of emotion processing, were demonstrated in HR subjects. This appears to be a potential endophenotype. These deficits could underlie the pathogenesis in BD, with possible frontolimbic circuitry impairment.

The study sought to investigate about how social interest could be an important predictor of social well-being across multiple life span development stages. A total of 360 participants, males and females, with age ranging from 15 to 65 years (M = 33.50, SD = 11.99), belonging to two ecological settings, i.e., rural (Gorakhpur region, eastern Uttar Pradesh, India) and urban (National Capital Region of Delhi, India), completed the Social Interest Index Scale (Greever et al., Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 41, 454–458, 1973) and Social Well-being Scale (Keyes, Social Psychology Quarterly, 61, 121–137, 1998) and responded to demographic questions. The results indicate how individuals differ in visualizing social interest and social well-being across adolescence, young adulthood, and middle adulthood stages. The regression findings show that the factors of social interest emerged less frequently as the predictors of social well-being. The study has obvious limitations due to correlational nature. The results, however, suggest that there is a need to inculcate and promote social interest across multiple life span development stages for the enhanced social well-being/wellness of society.

Life satisfaction is another outcome that describes the subjective well-being of any person and the quality of one’s life. Literature has already suggested the importance of parenting and peer relationships in the development of self-esteem which may lead to life satisfaction among adolescents. However, the relationship between three styles of parenting as well as peer attachment and life satisfaction mediated by self-esteem seems to be missing from the literature. This work is an important attempt toward fulfilling this research gap with respect to adolescents. The data were collected from 500 respondents which resulted in 412 functional responses. Structural equation modeling method was used to test the relationship in the study. The results revealed that both authoritative and permissive parenting have a positive influence on self-esteem in comparison to the negative influence of authoritarian parenting. Peer attachment also has an affirmative impact on self-esteem. Self-esteem also positively influences life satisfaction. Mediation results revealed that self-esteem partially mediates the association between three parenting styles, peer attachment, and life satisfaction. This study may offer unique insights to family counselors, couple counselors, and family educators about the role of different parenting styles and peer attachment with respect to the development of children’s self-esteem and life satisfaction. These results are also important for psychologists, sociologists, and other specialists with respect to understanding these factors for the well-being of adolescents. © The Author(s) 2021.",life satisfaction; parenting style; peer attachment; self-esteem,"SGT University, Gurgaon, Haryana, India; School of Behavioural Sciences, SGT University, Gurgaon, Haryana, India; Central University of Kashmir, , Jammu and Kashmir, Ganderbal, India; Jammu and Kashmir Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India",English

It is also widely accepted that lives of individuals had been undergoing change ever since the spread of COVID-19. Likewise, public's trust in the institutions is directly related to the civic engagement. Civic engagement is commonly understood as a phenomenon that develops a difference in an individual's civic life by combining values, skills, motivation, as well as knowledge. Different forms of civic engagement include national service, volunteering, societal services, and so forth. The main focus of this article is to examine the influence of COVID-19 outbreak on general attitude of the citizens of Malaysia and India, their trust on the governing institutions, and the civic engagement. In other words, this study tries to assess the impact of the pandemic on variables such as attitude toward the lockdown, trust in institutions, and civic engagement. For this, the study adopted cross-sectional community questionnaire survey in two countries—Malaysia and India. The respondents selected for the study was 1437. The respondent's demographics, attitude toward lockdown, trust in institutions, and civic engagement during the lockdown were collected by means of convenience sampling technique. Later the collected data were measured in terms of descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Findings of the study stated that public's trust in the institution can be increased by enhancing the civic activities and implementing policies that govern and build the society. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",attitude toward lockdown; civic engagement; COVID-19; nationwide lockdown; trust; trust in institution,"School of Business and Economics, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia; School of Economics and Management, Anshun University, Anshun, China; Department of Electronics and Communication, Anna University, Chennai, India",English

There is a dearth of literature in India regarding cognitive training interventions. Literature indicates that interventions from the west are not always feasible in low and middle-income countries. Compensatory Cognitive training by Dr Elizabeth Twamley aims to improve functional outcomes and an individual’s subjective experience of impairment and quality of life. The study aimed to culturally adapt and test the feasibility of the English version of the Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) manual to suit Indian culture. The study was conducted at Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The formative Method for Adapting Psychotherapy (FMAP) approach was used to adapt the manual culturally. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted with Mental Health Professionals, Caregivers, and Patients. The final version of the manual was piloted as a group intervention on 10 participants. Suggestions from the FGD’s predominantly changed Western names to Indian names and included culturally appropriate activities. The pilot phase was halted after seven sessions due to the pandemic. The sessions delivered were well received by the participants. Cultural adaptation of the Compensatory Cognitive Training Manual (CCT) was made as per the recommendations of the mental health experts and service users. Participant’s engagement and enthusiasm indicate that CCT seems to be a promising intervention to address cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia in Chennai, India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature India Private Limited.",Cognition; Cognitive Training; Compensatory approach; Cultural adaptation; Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia Research Foundation, R/7A, North Main Road, Anna Nagar West Extension, Chennai, Tamil Nadu  600101, India; Metro South Addiction and Mental Health Service, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia; Medical School University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia; Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Mangalore, Manipal, Karnataka  575001, India",English

We find that among human capital indicators, family health status results in a more positive mental state and fewer personal conflicts among PLHIV while having more working-age adults in the household results in more conflict. With regards to economic capital, PLHIV in salaried jobs and self-employment have a less positive mental state compared to those in daily wage work. Compared to daily wage workers, those in salaried jobs and self-employment exhibit lower addictive behavior. Self-employed PLHIV respondents also engage in fewer conflicts with their significant other. We do not find any correlation between social capital and psychological well-being. Job and financial insecurity are negatively associated with psychological well-being. While job insecurity is associated with an increase in addictive behavior, financial insecurity increases the likelihood of more frequent personal conflicts. We conclude that there is a need for greater economic and psychological support from institutions, community, and family to assuage the pandemic-induced psychological distress among PLHIV.

"Jain D., Kartik K.",Narrative of Feminist Resistance: Exploring Regulations of Leprosy in Postcolonial India,2021,Australian Feminist Law Journal,"Colonial policies on leprosy were predicated on the enactment of laws and the administration of systems that targeted ‘vagrancy' as disease control, subsuming classist, casteist, gendered and racial narratives within state response to the disease. Colonial state power, juxtaposed with the social capital of the Indian elite and ‘employed' middle classes, created exclusive spaces for containment of (hyper visible, and therefore most vulnerable) leprosy sufferers belonging to ‘lower-caste,' poor communities. Colonial regimes of disease control built on underlying notions of ‘morality' and ‘hygiene’ subsist, in one form or another, in the post-colonial state, furthered by neoliberal institutions that repurpose these notions through their development policies. Leprosy regulation narratives are still predicated on rationales relating to hygiene and economic development, which focus on caste, gender and hygiene markers for regulation. Resistance, in the background of colonial conceptions, policies and legislations relating to leprosy, has manifested within the very structures that have been set up to forcibly confine and isolate poor and marginalised persons with leprosy. In this article, we examine spaces of power created by the colonial state, giving rise to community spaces, unique power negotiations and narratives of resistance of the most marginalised. We critically trace the resistance of the ‘leper’ against draconian legislations, as well as ostracisation in the colonial and postcolonial period. Leprosy colonies have become sites of resistance where persons affected with leprosy did not passively suffer, but could reclaim their agency and re-imagine identities more positive than those ascribed to the infection. The alternative kinship structures that develop in these colonies facilitate unique care models that challenge dominant notions of families, hitherto predicated on marriage, adoption, or relatedness. Thus, we argue that leprosy colonies can be thought of not only as places of healing but as healing in and of themselves. © 2021 Australian Feminist Law Journal Inc.",,"Centre for Justice, Law and Society, Jindal Global Law School, India",English

Metacognitive awareness of these deficits, called neurocognitive insight (NI), has been found to be poor in schizophrenia patients but has not been assessed in their FDRs. This study evaluated NI and its relationship with objective cognitive performance, a history of psychotic experiences (PEs), and social functioning in unaffected FDRs. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. A total of 100 FDRs were assessed for PEs and evaluated for subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), objective cognitive performance, and social functioning using the Subjective Scale to Investigate Cognition in Schizophrenia, neurocognitive tests from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences battery, and SCARF Social Functioning Index, respectively. Results: Compared to normative data, episodic memory was the most commonly impaired domain (up to 72% of participants), followed by working memory, attention, and executive function. There was no correlation between SCC and neuropsychological test scores in the corresponding cognitive domains, implying poor NI. 15% of participants had a lifetime history of PEs. This group had significantly higher SCC as compared to those without PEs (U = 0.366, P = 0.009, r = 0.26). A regression analysis showed that the FDRs’ social functioning reduced by 0.178 units for each unit increase in SCC [F (1,98) = 5.198, P = 0.025]. Conclusion: Similar to schizophrenia patients, FDRs also have poor NI. The severity and progression of SCC could be explored as a possible marker for screening and monitoring FDRs at an ultrahigh risk for psychosis. Importantly, even in unaffected FDRs, SCC could affect socio-occupational functioning and need further research. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",first-degree relative; neurocognitive deficit; Neurocognitive insight; psychotic experience; schizophrenia; subjective cognition,"Dept. of Psychiatry, BYL Nair Charitable Hospital and Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; Dept. of Psychiatry, Sion Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak Memorial Medical College, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",English

This study aims to report the distribution, group differences and factor structure of autistic traits in Indian general population. The work also assesses the criterion validity of AQ across three patient group samples – autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, psychometric properties of the adapted AQ were assessed among 450 neurotypical university students matched for age. Confirmatory factor analysis was done to see if the adapted AQ fits the original factor structure. Test–retest, internal consistency reliability and criterion validity were found out. Group differences (gender and field of study) in AQ were also assessed. Findings: Autistic traits were found to be continuously distributed in the population, and patterns of group differences were consistent with previous studies. The adapted AQ had five factors resembling the original factor structure with a good fit, and 38 items instead of the original 50 items. Acceptable reliability coefficients were demonstrated along with criterion validity across clinical groups. Originality/value: This work is the first to present the pattern of distribution and factor structure of autistic traits among neurotypical adults from Eastern India, a culturally different population, as well as a reliable and valid tool to assess autistic traits in Bengali, a language with 300 million speakers. The findings add to the growing literature on AQ measurement and the concept of autism as a quantitative trait, examined outside of the western samples. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autism spectrum disorder; Autism–Spectrum Quotient; Autistic traits,"Department of Psychology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India; Department of Social Sciences, Maharaja Manindra Chandra College, Kolkata, India",English

An Open-Ended Judgment Study of Emotional Speech Prosody,2021,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"The current study investigated what can be understood from another person’s tone of voice. Participants from five English-speaking nations (Australia, India, Kenya, Singapore, and the United States) listened to vocal expressions of nine positive and nine negative affective states recorded by actors from their own nation. In response, they wrote open-ended judgments of what they believed the actor was trying to express. Responses cut across the chronological emotion process and included descriptions of situations, cognitive appraisals, feeling states, physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, emotion regulation, and attempts at social influence. Accuracy in terms of emotion categories was overall modest, whereas accuracy in terms of valence and arousal was more substantial. Coding participants’ 57,380 responses yielded a taxonomy of 56 categories, which included affective states as well as person descriptors, communication behaviors, and abnormal states. Open-ended responses thus reveal a wide range of ways in which people spontaneously perceive the intent behind emotional speech prosody. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",appraisal theory; emotion process; emotion recognition; free responses; speech prosody; vocal expression,"Washington University in St. LouisMO, United States; Stockholm University, Sweden; University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; University of California, Berkeley, United States; United States International University, Nairobi, Kenya; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Tripura University, Agartala, India",English

Using data collected from Indian sample, this paper develops a measurement of objects of cherishing in order to shed light on the constituents of this wider construct. We conducted seven studies with participants belonging to multiple Indian ethnicities to develop and validate an instrument for objects of cherishing. We define cherishing as a behavioral manifestation characterized by a strong sense of protectiveness, care, and emotional attachment towards a target which we call the objects of cherishing. Our findings reveal that these objects are strongly affiliated with secure attachment. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis shows that the objects of cherishing instrument has a robust four factor structure which is invariant across the sample, gender and broad ethnic groups included in the study. The present study also reveals concurrent and predictive validity as well as test-retest reliability of the objects of cherishing measurement tool based on a series of studies.

"George N., Egner T.",Stimulus variability and task relevance modulate binding-learning,2021,"Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics","Classical theories of attention posit that integration of features into object representation (or feature binding) requires engagement of focused attention. Studies challenging this idea have demonstrated that feature binding can happen outside of the focus of attention for familiar objects, as well as for arbitrary color-orientation conjunctions. Detection performance for arbitrary feature conjunction improves with training, suggesting a potential role of perceptual learning mechanisms in the integration of features, a process called “binding-learning”. In the present study, we investigate whether stimulus variability and task relevance, two critical determinants of visual perceptual learning, also modulate binding-learning. Transfer of learning in a visual search task to a pre-exposed color-orientation conjunction was assessed under conditions of varying stimulus variability and task relevance. We found transfer of learning for the pre-exposed feature conjunctions that were trained with high variability (Experiment 1). Transfer of learning was not observed when the conjunction was rendered task-irrelevant during training due to pop-out targets (Experiment 2). Our findings show that feature binding is determined by principles of perceptual learning, and they support the idea that functions traditionally attributed to goal-driven attention can be grounded in the learning of the statistical structure of the environment. © 2021, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",Feature binding; Habitual attention; Perceptual learning; Variability; Visual search,"Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382355, India; Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC  27708, United States; Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Duke University, Durham, NC  27708, United States",English

Understanding the difficulties of physicians with SUDs would facilitate early identification and reduce the complications they face in various domains, particularly in settings where there are no physician-health care programs. In this background, we aimed to understand the challenges physicians with SUDs face at their workplace. Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews of 21 physicians receiving treatment from a tertiary care addiction medicine center for their SUD were conducted and, based on the transcripts from the interview after coding and recoding, through inductive content analysis, themes and subthemes were identified. Results: The following occupational challenges were identified: direct consequences of the psychoactive effect of the substance, adverse effects on clinical care and service delivery, impairment in regularity and punctuality, changes in the physicians’ behaviors, changes in the work environment and diverse responses of colleagues and the hospital administration toward substance use-related actions, ethical issues at workplace, and effects on career growth.

An index capturing patriarchy may afford increased understanding of this social system, and may serve to complement other gender equality indices. This paper involves the development and testing of a novel composite measure, the India Patriarchy Index, to quantify the social and ideological construct of patriarchy using empirical data on family structure and gender roles. Using data from India’s National Family Health Survey, we develop an India Patriarchy Index to measure gendered social positioning in families based on sex by age, patrilocality, sex ratio imbalance among offspring, and gendered economic roles. Psychometric testing demonstrates good internal reliability and construct validity of this index, with validity indicated by its association with three gender equality indices used in India. Spatial and temporal analyses further indicate much state-level variation in India Patriarchy Index scores as well as slow change on this indicator over time, based on time trend analyses from 1992–93 to 2015–16.

This patient series describes the usefulness and feasibility of conducting behavioral interventions for patients with TD from an Indian general hospital psychiatric unit. Behavioral treatments in these seven consecutively treated adult/adolescent patients with TD included all components of habit reversal treatment, comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, and exposure with response prevention in some patients. Patients were predominantly male, with adolescent-onset severe TD, typical features and psychiatric comorbidities, and poor response to multiple medications prior to the institution of behavior therapy. In addition to long delays in diagnosis, none of the patients or their caregivers had been informed by the doctors they had consulted earlier about TD or the need for behavioral treatments before attending our center. Institution of behavioral treatments along with medications led to a 75% reduction in the severity of tics and reduction in comorbid symptoms. Patients and caregivers also reported similar rates of improvement as well as reductions in subjective distress and caregiver burden. Five patients have been followed up for seven months to seven years; apart from one patient, all others have had only minor exacerbations of tics during this period. This limited experience suggests that behavior therapies for TD can be successfully implemented in low-resource, non-specialized Indian settings. They are effective, and gains from such treatment are usually enduring. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",behavior therapy; India; Tourette’s disorder,"Dept. of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institution of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India",English

Only a few Indian studies have focused on this. No Indian studies could be found that explored the caregivers’ experiences of aggressive persons with schizophrenia. This study was conducted to explore the same. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological study was conducted in the outpatient and inpatient settings at a tertiary care mental health institute at Bengaluru, Karnataka. Ten participants meeting the eligibility criteria were selected using purposive sampling. Data collection was done by individual, in-depth, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews using topic guide along with subjective observation and field notes. Each interview was audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and coded. A total of five master themes and 22 subthemes were derived from the codes by using the qualitative research software ATLAS-Ti. Results: The themes derived based on the experiences of caregivers living with their aggressive persons with schizophrenia were the aggressive behaviors of the patients, reasons for the aggression of the patients, dealing with the aggression of the patients, the impact of aggression on the caregivers, and the coping methods of the caregivers. Conclusion: This study explored the experiences of the caregivers living with the aggressive patients. The results show the need for care and support to the caregivers. The themes can guide mental health professionals while developing culture-specific tools and interventions for future research as well as suggest them standard operating procedures for prevention and management of aggressive patients in the psychiatric hospitals. © 2021 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",aggression; caregiver; experiences; schizophrenia; violence,"Dept. of Mental Health Nursing, Jubilee Mission College of Nursing, Thrissur, Kerala, India; Dept. of Nursing, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Department of Clinical Psychology, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

"Arun P., Ramamurthy P., Thilakan P.","Indian Medical Students with Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidal Behavior: Why Do They Not Seek Treatment?",2021,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Identification of barriers to mental healthcare seeking among medical students will help organize student mental health services in medical colleges across India. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, and suicidal behavior among medical students and to identify the potential barriers to mental healthcare seeking among them. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, the medical students from a medical college in South India were asked to complete a structured pro forma for sociodemographic details, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7),and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). The barriers to mental healthcare seeking were assessed using the mental health subscale of Barriers to Healthcare Seeking Questionnaire for medical students. A cut-off of 15 was used for determining the presence of depression on PHQ-9. A cut-off of 10 on GAD-7 indicated the presence of anxiety disorder, and a cut-off of 7 on SBQ-R indicated suicidal risk. Results: Out of the 425 participants, 59 (13.9%) were found to have depression (moderately severe or severe) and 86 (20.2%) were found to have anxiety disorders (moderate or severe). A total of 126 (29.6%) students were found to have a suicidal risk. Preference for informal consultations, concerns about confidentiality, and preference for self-diagnosis were the most commonly reported barriers to mental healthcare seeking. Students with psychiatric disorders perceived more barriers to mental healthcare seeking than students without psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: One-fourth of the medical students were detected to have depression and/or anxiety disorders.

"Pandey R., Tiwari G.K., Rai P.K.",Restoring and preserving capacity of self-affirmation for well-being in Indian adults with non-clinical depressive tendencies,2021,Current Issues in Personality Psychology,"Background: Although self-affirmation has been reported to enhance well-being and other positive life outcomes in normal adults, little is known about its capacity to restore and preserve well-being in adults with depressive tendencies. The current study attempts to expound the restoring and preserving capacity of self-affirmation for well-being in Indian adults with non-clinical depressive tendencies. Participants and Procedure: The study used a sequential research design. Eighty participants (22-27 years) with depressive tendencies were chosen through purposive sampling and were randomly assigned equally to the experimental and control conditions. Their depressive tendencies and well-being were measured through standard scales at three intervals: preintervention, post-intervention and follow-up. Results: The results revealed significant restoring and preserving capacity of self-affirmation for the well-being of the experimental group participants as compared to the control group. The main effects of conditions (experimental, control) and treatment intervals (pre, post, follow-up) were significant along with the interaction effects of conditions × treatment intervals. The significant differences in the mean well-being scores for pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up points of time showed the restoring and preserving capacity of self-affirmation intervention. Conclusions: The findings showed that self-affirmation helps to restore well-being as well as preserve it after a significant gap, which is evident in higher well-being mean scores of the experimental group taken at post-intervention and followup intervals. The positive effects of self-affirmation on well-being may have remained active even after the cessation of the intervention due to the underlying mechanisms of enhanced self-worth, positive values, inner strengths, positive attributions and interpersonal relationships. © 2021 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.

Among disorders emerging in the aftermath of a disaster, depression is the second most common. Aim: The current study was aimed to estimate the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) at two-time points in individuals who have been hospitalized for the treatment of COVID 19. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out from May 2020 to October 2020 at a tertiary care center among patients discharged after recovery from novel coronavirus (COVID 19). A diagnostic clinical interview was conducted to diagnose MDD, and its severity in patients who had recovered from COVID 19 using 'Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)' at the time of discharge and 1 month after their discharge from the hospital. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used for the analysis, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 440 participants participated in the study. Out of them, 30.90% of participants met the criteria for MDD at the time of discharge and 19.5% at 1 month post-discharge. Participants who stayed for more than 14 days, were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and those with co-morbid medical illness had a higher prevalence of MDD. Conclusion: High prevalence of MDD was observed at the time of discharge among hospitalized participants. Longer duration of hospital stay and admission in ICU is associated with more unpleasant events, subsequently resulting in higher rates of morbidity, such as depression. © 2021 Archives of Mental Health | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Depressive disorder; pandemics; SARS-Cov-19; survivors,"Department of Psychiatry, M.P.

Rooted in boundary theory, the authors examined the influence of COVID-19 on flourishing and parental stress, respectively. Furthermore, predicated on spillover theory, the study explored the mediating effect of parental stress. Method: In this research, 259 IT employees in India were prospectively followed from the second week until the twentieth week of lockdown as part of a longitudinal population. A three-stage data collection method was employed. The employee completed the COVID-19 impact scale in the 2nd and 10th week of lockdown in India. Subsequently, the authors administered parental stress and flourishing surveys online in the 20th week. Results: Findings revealed that COVID-19 negatively impacted employee flourishing, via parental stress that had a partial mediating effect. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to theoretically and empirically investigate the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on employees’ flourishing via parental stress. Based on the findings, the organizations can enhance their employees' flourishing by providing the autonomy to control their work time, and adequate training to better handle COVID-19 impact and parental stress to have better and sustainable human resources. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Clinical Impact Statement—The present study revealed that COVID-19 positively influenced parental stress while it negatively impacted employee flourishing. Furthermore, parental stress had a partial mediating effect on COVID-19 and employees’ flourishing relationships. To have a sustainable human resource, the managers and organizations must provide the employee with autonomy concerning their work time and adequate training to handle the COVID 19 stress.

"Shaffakat S., Otaye-Ebede L., Reb J., Chandwani R., Vongswasdi P.",Mindfulness attenuates both emotional and behavioral reactions following psychological contract breach: A two-stage moderated mediation model.,2021,Journal of Applied Psychology,"Breach of the psychological contract between organization and employee often evokes employee hostility, which in turn can instigate deviant behaviors. We examine whether employee mindfulness attenuates these reactions to psychological contract breach. Specifically, we develop and test a two-stage moderated mediation model in which employee mindfulness moderates the mediational path from psychological contract breach via hostility to deviance by attenuating both emotional and behavioral reactions. Findings across four studies (with 872 employee participants) both measuring and manipulating breach and mindfulness demonstrate substantial support for the proposed model. Further analyses including alternative moderators, mediators, and dependent variables provide evidence for discriminatory and incremental validity. We discuss theoretical and practical implications as well as future research avenues.

"Jangam S., Deodhar M., Wankhede S.",Synthesis and biological evaluation of amino acid based mutual amide prodrugs of phenytoin as anticonvulsant agents,2021,Central Nervous System Agents in Medicinal Chemistry,"Background: Phenytoin (5,5-diphenyl hydantoin) has poor water solubility, which results in incomplete oral availability. Other problems associated with the oral and intramuscular administration of phenytoin are gastric irritation and inflammation at the site of injection. Objective: The purpose of this study was to synthesize mutual amide prodrugs of phenytoin by using amino acids like glycine, L-tryptophan, L-lysine and taurine. Methods: These prodrugs were synthesized and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Mass Spectra. Physical and spectral characterization was performed by determination of solubility, maximum wavelength, partition coefficient (log P), ionization constant (pKa), specific (α) and molar rotation (μ), refractive index (n), specific refraction (RS) and molar refraction (RM). Results: The results obtained from solubility and log P values determination indicated that pheny-toin prodrugs can be administered by oral as well as a parenteral route by minimizing the limitations associated with phenytoin. Anticonvulsant activity of prodrugs (4a-4d) was evaluated by using maximal electroshock (MES) and strychnine induced seizure test on albino mice of either sex weighing 25-30 g in which 4b and 4d were found to have significant anticonvulsant activity for MES and strychnine induced seizure test. In vitro enzymatic hydrolysis study of 4b and 4d was performed on liver, intestinal mucosa and plasma sample of male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 280-300 g in which phenytoin was eluted at 10.13 to 10.68 minutes at 220 nm. Conclusion: The results obtained from the present work showed that amino acid-based mutual prodrug strategy can be a promising method to increase the solubility and anticonvulsant activity of phenytoin for the development of anticonvulsant agents. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",Amino acid; Anticonvulsant; Hydrolysis; Mutual prodrug; Phenytoin; Solubility,"Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, JSPM’s Charak College of Pharmacy and Research, Pune-Nagar Road, Wagholi, Pune, Maharashtra, India; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, PDEA’s Seth Govind Raghunath Sable College of Pharmacy, Saswad, Pune, Maharashtra, India; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Datta Meghe College of Pharmacy, Salod, Wardha, Maharashtra, India",English
"Roy A., Chouhan P.",Girl child marriage in Malda district of West Bengal: analysis of prevalence and socio-economic factors,2021,Vulnerable Children and Youth Studies,"This paper examines the prevalence and socio-economic factors on child marriage in the Malda district of West Bengal using a mixed-methods approach: in-depth qualitative interviews of female victims of child marriage as well as quantitative data collected using structured interviews of women. Quantitative analysis reveals that educational attainment had an inverse relationship with girl-child marriage. This study also found that women who belonged to low-income families were more likely to married-off their daughter at an early age compared to high-income families. The qualitative information indicated multiple themes related to the causes of child marriage such as economic vulnerability due to land erosion, siblings as sisters, and comeliness of girls. The findings of the study suggest that child marriage could be prevented by increasing opportunities for girls’ education and employment. The targeted approach should be made among rural and poor girls to combat the practice of child marriage. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Child marriage; education; harmful practices; natural disaster; poverty,"Department of Geography, University of Gour Banga, Malda, West Bengal, India; State Aided College Teacher, Department of Geography, Malda College, Malda, West Bengal, India",English
"Sahni P., Kumar J.",Exploring the relationship of human–nature interaction and mindfulness: a cross-sectional study,2021,"Mental Health, Religion and Culture","History is replete with examples where humans have sought refuge in nature for psychological restoration. In this cross-sectional study we explore the relationship of nature experience and mindfulness. Nature experience is assessed through “nature in the neighbourhood”, “frequency of visit” to nature-rich spaces, as well as one's inherent connection with nature described as “nature relatedness”. The study sample consisted of 334 Indian adults. The findings from this study show that frequency of visit to nature-rich spaces has a significant positive association with mindfulness. The hierarchical regression analysis suggests an interaction effect of “nature relatedness” in the association of the presence of nature rich spaces in the neighbourhood, frequency of visit as well as mindfulness. Interestingly, when childhood experiences were explored they had a significant association with “nature relatedness” and mindfulness. The evidence from this research suggests that nature experience may find its application as one of the mindfulness techniques prescribed for self-management of mental health problems. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",attention; hierarchical regression; mindfulness; Nature in neighbourhood; nature relatedness; path analysis; visit frequency,"National Resource Centre for Value Education in Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India; Department of Design, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India",English

A study on the influence of convergent and divergent thinking on eye movement,2021,Psychological Research,"Research indicates that deliberate thinking and eye movements are related. However, how various thought processes influence eye movements is not explored well. The present research examined the role of convergent and divergent thinking in eye movement. Divergent thinking involves novel alternatives, multiple uses, and unconventional answers which may require scanning visual surroundings precisely and extensively. Hence, it was hypothesized that divergent thinking would involve more scattered and detailed visual scanning than convergent thinking. Two experiments were conducted using repeated measures design: both involved a visual remote association task for convergent thinking and an adapted visual task of the alternate uses task for divergent thinking. Experiment 1 tracked participants’ eye movement while solving the task when images of objects were on the screen; whereas, in Experiment 2, the blank screen paradigm was used where the images of items were removed and the eyes were tracked while participants solved the task. Data analysis showed that the eye movements were more object focused during convergent thinking than divergent thinking. The results confirmed that participants in divergent thinking had more detailed and dispersed visual scanning than in convergent thinking. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Department of Psychology, Sikkim University, 6th Miles, Samadur, Gangtok, Sikkim, India",English
"Narang R., Iipinge S., Tiwari S.","Abrupt transition from offline to online learning during COVID-19: Perceptions, motives & experiences of higher education students",2021,Youth Voice Journal,"Purpose: Recognizing the importance of remote learning, the current study assesses the university students’ perceptions and motives towards transitioning to online learning amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, an attempt has been made to identify their learning experiences as well. Design/Methodology/Approach: Data was gathered through interviews with Higher Education students. Nvivo 12 plus software was used for analyzing the collected data. Findings: Findings lead to some new motives that drive higher education students to attend online classes such as continuity of studies, securing good marks, attendance, increase in technical literacy, flexibility and social interaction. However, online learning offers both various advantages over classroom teaching and also poses unique challenges particularly in those education institutes that are totally unfamiliar with online teaching experience and were unprepared for online teaching but were compelled by circumstances (COVID) to make this transition. Research limitations: The study was limited to students’ perception only. Future research may be carried out to understand the perception of teachers and educational institutions and the challenges faced by them during the transition from classroom learning to online learning. The current study has not focused on the assessment part of learning; therefore, future studies can also explore this aspect of learning in online classes. Social Implications: The study provides meaningful insights to higher educational institutions, policy makers and government. Originality/Value: Abrupt closure of educational institutions due to the spread of COVID-19 has adversely affected the smooth running of classroom teaching forcing the universities and colleges to adopt online mode to ensure continuity in learning. Considering that the pandemic is likely to impede class teaching and also that the market for e-learning is growing in India, the need to research on students’ transitions to online learning becomes an important contribution to the development and implementation of e-learning systems in higher education institutions in India. © 2021 RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR ALL.",COVID-19; Learning experience; Motives; Online learning; Perception; Remote learning; Students,"Department of Business Administration, University of Lucknow, India; Namibia University of Science and Technology, Namibia; University of Lucknow, India; Department of Business Administration, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, 226007, India",English
"Shukla R., Saha S.",Establishing the effectiveness of intervention module on positive youth development among adolescent in India,2021,Youth Voice Journal,"Purpose: Positive Youth Development (PYD) originated in the west as a pragmatic approach to teaching youth skills and attributes to develop into healthy, productive, and engaged adults. This approach proposes that youth with more developmental resources experience increased academic success, better economic prospects, are more civically engaged, and experience optimal well-being and functioning in the long term. Over time, the need for administering evidence-based interventions was felt by practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. With this background and the absence of research in PYD in India, the present research was carried out to develop and test an intervention module for its effectiveness in bringing about a positive change among youth. Approach: The present research is quantitative in nature with pre-test post-test control group design. The PYD intervention program included activities, non-profit visits, community building exercises, and mentoring programs, creating self-actualizing youth. The paper deliberates on the findings of a six-month interventional program based on the Six C’s model of Learner (2005). Findings: The independent sample t-test was significant, for overall PYD, t (98) = 3.45, p <. 001. and on all the dimensions of PYD, indicating that intervention was effective as there are statistically significant differences among experimental and control groups. Value: The intervention was experientially positive for the students, valued, and commended by the school authorities. The paper recommends enhancing psychological intervention research in school settings, including multiple approaches to address holistic student development, facilitating peer relationships and mentoring, developing resources, and enhancing growth opportunities. © 2021 RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR ALL.",Adolescents; India; Intervention; Positive psychology; Positive youth development,"Department of Psychology, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Delhi NCR, Nandgram Rd, Marium Nagar, Sewa Nagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, 201003, India; Department of Psychology, India; University of Oviedo, Spain",English
"Soumya R.R., Sathiyaseelan A.",Mindfulness: An emotional aid to the glass ceiling experiences,2021,Cogent Psychology,"We have progressed to a phase where there is very little difference between men and women, but the reality in many countries is that women are looked down as the inferior gender and not given career opportunities to explore. They are not let into the decision-making roles at the organization even when they have an equal qualification, experience and skill. They are placed low in the hierarchy which allows them to witness the functions at the higher level of the organization but restricts them from participating in them. There are a lot of factors like cultural, socio-demographic factors and society itself that influence this disparity in the organization. These contributory factors create the glass ceiling phenomenon at the workplace, thereby generating emotional and psychological imbalances in women employees. This is a conceptual paper aiming to explore the concept and impact of mindfulness, and various concepts of mindfulness could be used as an emotional aid to treat the psychological effects of the glass ceiling. It further explains some of the mindful concepts like mindful walking, mindful life and mindfulness-based stress reduction technique in treating some of the psychological and emotional issues like depression, anxiety, frustration, traumatic experiences, adjustment issues, addiction, stress, low self-esteem, low self-confidence and aggression. It also elucidates adopting mindfulness techniques in real organizational scenarios where women are constantly discriminated because of their gender and opportunities are taken away. © 2021 The Author(s).

Therefore, the detection of Hg2++ ions in water is a very important issue for improving human health and water quality. Metallic nanoparticles such as gold and silver nanoparticles (AuNPs &amp; AgNPs) have received much attention due to their colorimetric properties as well as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties. AuNPs and AgNPs can easily change their color (AuNPs: Red to Pink/Blue; AgNPs: Yellow to blue) which is easily discriminated by visual inspection. Functionalization of AuNPs and AgNPs offers an excellent application in many scientific worlds as the choice of ligands/functionalizing groups is of utmost importance for their colloidal stability and function of the nanoparticles.

"Haobijam S., Singh K.A.",Socioeconomic Determinants of Domestic Violence in Northeast India: Evidence From the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4),2021,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,"Violence against women is now widely recognized as an important public health problem, owing to its health consequences. Domestic violence generally refers to violence against women that generally takes place in the matrimonial home, which includes physical, emotional, sexual as well as economical violence occurring in the adult relationship. Domestic violence has negative impact on the demographic outcome of a country or region, which includes the health and health seeking behavior of women. The present study is an attempt to investigate the socioeconomic factors that would significantly influence domestic violence in the northeastern region of India. The northeastern region of India comprises of eight states, including Manipur and Sikkim, which are reported having the highest and the least prevalence of domestic violence in the whole country according to NFHS-4. Considering these reports and having a different socioeconomic setup as compared to other states in the mainland India, we selected the region for the current study. Data from NFHS-4 conducted during 2015–16 is being employed for the present study. Findings show that education of women, wealth, women’s working status, religion, parity of women, and husband’s alcohol use are some of the significant covariates that might have influenced domestic violence. The overall prevalence of physical, emotional, sexual, and severe physical violence among women of northeastern India are 24.7%, 11.8%, 6.4%, and 5.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis computes the relative risks of categorical variables via the odds ratios. Those women who got higher education and are in upper wealth quintiles have less risk of experiencing domestic violence as compared to women in lower education and lower wealth quintile in northeastern India. There is no rural urban difference in experiencing domestic violence in the region. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",alcohol and drugs; domestic violence; GLBT; sexual assault; violence against,"Manipur University, Manipur, India",English

Today, solid waste management is gaining so much of an importance because lack of planning could affect the quality of social, economic and environmental sustainability. Most of the studies have illustrated production of solid waste is due to human needs and desires and the best strategy of solid waste management is to tackle at the point of origin. However, to measure such pro-environmental behaviours among residents, an appropriate and a replicable scale is important. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explain the processes undertaken to develop a valid instrument to measure the antecedents of solid waste management behaviour. The constructs were assessed using Ajzen’s theory of planned behaviour and data was collected from a survey of 233 students belonging to three different colleges of Udupi district, India. The specific validation processes used were: mixed methods approach of content validity, face validity, construct validity, reliability, internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha correlation coefficient, discriminant validity and convergent validity. Measurement invariance for urban and rural groups was established and the measured model adopted confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling technique for assessing the psychometric properties of constructs. A final and fifth version of questionnaire was designed with 57 items from the initial indicators of 132 items.

Methods: Forty-six individuals with ABI were examined at week 1 and 5 of hospitalization. OHRQoL was recorded through Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), clinical oral examinations were conducted, while orofacial health-related ‘motor’ and ‘cognitive’ scores were retrieved from patients’ e-journal. Association between variables were investigated using factor analysis and multilevel regression modeling. Results: There were no significant differences in the OHIP-14 scores between week 1 and 5. Factors analysis revealed two OHIP-14 domains, ‘psychosocial’ and ‘physica‘. Individuals who improved their cognitive skills over study period and those with ‘severe’ periodontitis at baseline had increased scores of OHIP-14 ‘psychosocial’ domain. Individuals who improved orofacial health-related ‘motor’ skills over study period had decreased ‘physical’ domain scores. Increased cognition over study period, current smoking and dental calculus were associated with increased ‘physical’ domain. Conclusions: The OHRQoL was poor both at week 1 and 5. Individual’s cognitive and motor skills as well as their oral health status influenced their OHRQoL.

Nandy R.,Facebook and the Covid-19 Crisis: Building Solidarity Through Community Feeling,2021,Human Arenas,"In the event of the Covid-19 spread, the entire world has been brought to a stop due to the imposed lockdown, to counter the effects of the spreading virus. This paper proposes to study the change in how people are experiencing a pandemic very differently and what such changes imply with respect to social connections and human interactions. The networked digital citizens come together in the time of crisis, sharing a sense of nostalgia as well as perseverance on Facebook. The paper will refer to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in order to explain the human need for the sense of belonging. A pandemic has not been experienced in earlier time as a global phenomenon with far reaching consequences as in the present context. People across the world are experiencing a similar form of loneliness, boredom, and anxiety irrespective of which profession one belongs to. The absence of physical movement has suddenly caused a great shift of interaction on to the Facebook platform. The corner stone for virtual social interaction had already been laid down with the rise of a ‘convergence culture’. Social communities depicting shared interests like music, dance, photography, food, and other aspects of life have been redesigned and restructured as a result of the lockdown. More and more people are sharing videos of activities they are engaging in during this time of immobility. A greater focus of family experiences are being shared by celebrities, creating a semblance of solidarity in fighting against the psychological effects of a long term lockdown. The provision of the care button on Facebook also intensifies this sense of a shared trauma and the human desire to overcome all hurdles together. The paper will focus on a number of Facebook trends, beginning from Dalgona coffee and its perception to music covers of popular songs such as ‘Dance Monkey’ and Bella Ciao. The historical meaning associated with the term ‘crisis’ is being redefined in a social context which greatly based on a networked population. This has an entirely different social and psychological implication.

However, there is a dearth of information regarding parent–child storybook reading experiences in Indian home contexts. This study investigated parental perspectives towards storybook reading in the Indian context among 100 parents of typically developing preschool children. In this questionnaire-based study, parental responses were collected and the patterns of reading exposure, child’s interest in reading, storybook reading practices, and attitudes & beliefs towards storybook reading were reported using descriptive statistics. Correlation between demographic variables (i.e., child’s age and socioeconomic status) and storybook reading domains were explored. The majority of parents initiated storybook reading with their children at 2 years of age or older. Parents read to their children one to two times per week for 10 min and had fewer than 10 books in the home. Parents reported that their children were interested in storybook reading and reported the use of quality storybook reading practices. Homes characterized with higher socioeconomic status included more quality home literacy environment factors, although socioeconomic status did not correlate with the parental beliefs and attitudes towards reading. Results provide preliminary information regarding parental perspectives on storybook reading in Indian home contexts and point toward socioeconomic and sociocultural variation in home literacy environments. Understanding more about the parental interactions surrounding storybook reading will facilitate the development of parent programs to enhance and promote quality home literacy environment in Indian home contexts. © 2021, The Author(s).",Attitudes and beliefs; Preschool children; Reading exposure; Reading interest; Reading practices; Storybook reading,"Department of Speech & Hearing, Manipal College of Health Professions, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India; Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, Lamar University, Beaumont, TX, United States",English
Baviskar A.,"Street food and the art of survival: migrants and places in Delhi, India",2021,"Food, Culture and Society","The modernist conception of urban order is predicated on state regulation of city spaces and social practices. Street food vending disrupts this idealized order and is therefore denounced by state officials and the bourgeois public. Hamstrung by this hostile discursive field and their own lack of symbolic capital, how do food vendors manage to maneuver their way through an inhospitable city? In this paper, I use ethnographic vignettes from two neighborhoods in Delhi to argue that street vendors and city spaces should not be treated as homogeneous categories; differences among vendors and between urban settings are crucial for explaining heterogeneous survival strategies. These differences relate to ethnic identities derived from diverse histories of migration, as well as to the variegated layout, land use and legal geographies of spaces in the city. I conclude by showing that negotiations over food vending now occur not only on the street, but also through the virtual world of food blogs and videos. By representing street food as a valued part of city culture, the internet has emerged as a new space where the claims of street vendors acquire greater legitimacy in the public sphere. © 2021 Association for the Study of Food and Society.",Delhi; ethnicity; India; migration; municipal regulation; public space; social media; Street food,"Department of Sociology-Anthropology and Department of Environmental Studies, Ashoka University, Sonepat, India",English

Aim of the study: To assess the psychological disturbances that the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted on healthcare workers in India and to assess the correlation between different parameters including socio-demographic variables, job-related variables, personal history and psychological disturbances such as perceived stress, depression and anxiety. Material and methods: Health care workers from a few tertiary care institutes (government as well as private sectors, which are caring for patients with COVID-19) in a western state of India were invited to participate with a self-administered online questionnaire. That questionnaire consisted of self-report scales including Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 items (DASS 21), and the Perceived Stress Scale with socio-demographic, job-related and personal details. Results: Out of 302 subjects, on the Perceived Stress Scale, 101 (33.44%) reported low, 185 (61.26%) moderate and 16 (5.30%) high levels of stress. On DASS 21, depression was reported by 56 (18.54%) subjects, 60 (19.87%) subjects were found to have anxiety and 50 (16.56%) subjects reported to have stress. Perceived stress score on Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was significantly correlated with the depression, anxiety and stress score on DASS 21. A few risk factors such as female gender, single marital status, past history of psychiatric illness, working as interns and residents doctors with lesser experience and high risk duty areas such as COVID-19 duties in a particular situation were significantly associated with psychological disturbances such as stress, depression and anxiety. Conclusions: We observed significant psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs as well as a few risk factors related to it.

The decline in working memory has been reported in normal as well as pathological aging. Aims: The present study aimed to assess working memory capacity using a paradigm within E-Prime software and study its effect on linguistic processing ability in adults with and without dementia using the n-back task. Methods and Procedures: A standard group comparison was carried out across 10 neurotypical individuals and 7 individuals with dementia. A working memory task (n-back) was employed and the effect of various semantic stimuli categories on working memory was identified. Outcome and Results: The findings of this study revealed that individuals with dementia significantly differ in their working memory capacity when compared to neurotypical individuals. Poor working memory capacity could be due to the impaired ability to access semantic information of their linguistic ability and slow processing speed. Differences were also found concerning the processing of various semantic stimuli categories within both the study groups. Increased reaction time with poor working memory threshold was observed objectively in individuals with dementia compared to neruotypicals. The differences in terms of reaction time are attributed to the varied processing load put forth by different semantic stimuli within the working memory and to some extrinsic factors such as familiarity with the stimulus. Conclusions: The study evidences the importance of objective working memory assessment in differentiating individuals with dementia and neurotypical individuals. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",dementia; linguistic processing; n-Back; semantics: E-Prime software,"Department of Speech-Language Sciences, All India Institute of Speech $and$ Hearing, Mysuru, India; Department of Audiology, All India Institute of Speech $and$ Hearing, Mysuru, India",English
"Maji S., Bansod S., Singh T.",Domestic violence during COVID-19 pandemic: The case for Indian women,2021,Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology,"Domestic violence is one of the most pernicious gendered ailments of human society. Researchers have confirmed the inevitable consequences of domestic violence (physical, sexual, and emotional) in increased vulnerability to psychopathologies in addition to physical morbidity. Domestic violence cases are vast in India, and the numbers are further aggravated at an alarming rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed at exploring the cases of domestic violence among Indian women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Newspapers reporting the incidents of domestic violence during the last 5 years were analysed to explore the issues related to the surge in domestic violence incidents during the COVID-19 lockdown period. A major increase in domestic violence cases was observed during the COVID-19 period as compared to the previous years. Also, the cases were higher during the initial phases of the pandemic but gradually decreased as time progressed.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women was unprecedented and worse than before. Home containment as a measure to protect the health and well-being of the general public has resulted in increased sufferings for women in terms of both sufferings from diseases and increased domestic violence. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",COVID-19; domestic violence; gender; pandemic,"Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India; Data Science Division, Bakken & Bæck, Oslo, Norway; Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",English
"Vittal Rao H., Bihaqi S.W., Iannucci J., Sen A., Grammas P., Rhea E.",Thrombin Signaling Contributes to High Glucose-Induced Injury of Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells,2021,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,"Background: Diabetes is one of the strongest disease-related risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In diabetics, hyperglycemia-induced microvascular complications are the major cause of end-organ injury, contributing to morbidity and mortality. Microvascular pathology is also an important and early feature of AD. The cerebral microvasculature may be a point of convergence of both diseases. Several lines of evidence also implicate thrombin in AD as well as in diabetes. Objective: Our objective was to investigate the role of thrombin in glucose-induced brain microvascular endothelial injury. Methods: Cultured Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) were treated with 30 mM glucose±100 nM thrombin and±250 nM Dabigatran or inhibitors of PAR1, p38MAPK, MMP2, or MMP9. Cytotoxicity and thrombin activity assays on supernatants and western blotting for protein expression in lysates were performed. Results: reatment of HBMVECs with 30 mM glucose increased thrombin activity and expression of inflammatory proteins TNFα, IL-6, and MMPs 2 and 9; this elevation was reduced by the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. Direct treatment of brain endothelial cells with thrombin upregulated p38MAPK and CREB, and induced TNFα, IL6, MMP2, and MMP9 as well as oxidative stress proteins NOX4 and iNOS. Inhibition of thrombin, thrombin receptor PAR1 or p38MAPK decrease expression of inflammatory and oxidative stress proteins, implying that thrombin may play a central role in glucose-induced endothelial injury. Conclusion: Since preventing brain endothelial injury would preserve blood-brain barrier integrity, prevent neuroinflammation, and retain intact functioning of the neurovascular unit, inhibiting thrombin, or its downstream signaling effectors, could be a therapeutic strategy for mitigating diabetes-induced dementia. © 2021-IOS Press.

In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov’s original analysis strategy, the valence–dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence–dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.

Recognition of schizophrenia by the presentation of a case vignette is often used to assess MHL. Various studies assessing MHL around the world have shown that the recognition of schizophrenia is low. This study was designed to use the case vignette method to assess the MHL in a sample of respondents in North India. Methodology: We translated a well-known case vignette of schizophrenia from english into hindi. A cross-sectional study design was followed. This case vignette was presented in the written format to 200 respondents in rural Punjab and Haryana. The case vignette was followed by questions regarding the identification and nature of the problem, what could be done about it and the familiarity of the respondent to the term ‘schizophrenia’. The results were analysed through open coding. Results: Around 22% of the responses identified mental illness. The recognition of schizophrenia by name was only in one response. Most people attributed the condition of the protagonist in the case vignette to be due to stressful life situations. The respondents used the terms ‘depression’ and ‘tension’ as descriptors of mental illness. The correction of situations leading to stress and counselling by a psychiatrist was considered by most respondents to be useful. The familiarity with schizophrenia was 18%. Conclusions: MHL in our sample was low. Measures for improving the MHL in the community are needed. There may be a case for easier nomenclature with regards to MHL. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Assessment; Case vignette; Culture; India; Mental health literacy; Schizophrenia,"Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India",English

"Halli S.S., Biradar R.A.","Age at marriage and HIV vulnerability among young married women living with HIV in northern Karnataka, India",2021,Children and Youth Services Review,"The purpose of the study is to explore whether marriage age possibly a risk factor for HIV infection among young women living with HIV in a high HIV risk area of southern India. We used data from a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected currently married HIV-positive women aged 15 to 29. The analysis of the data revealed that more than 75% of them got married before they reach their 17th birthday. More than 71% are from rural areas, and about half of them are illiterate. Surprisingly, 28% of women began to live with their current husbands before the age of 15, and as many as 73% of respondents began to live with their current husbands below the legal age at marriage of 18 years. The average age of the interviewees was 25.6 years, while that of husbands was 32.5 years, indicating that the average age gap between husbands and spouses was 7 years. Regarding the timing of their HIV diagnosis, 37% of the respondents were diagnosed their HIV status during pregnancy and a higher percentage of younger ones were tested HIV positive when respondents were pregnant (61%) as compared to older respondents. In the past 2 years, 58% of the respondents have diagnosed with HIV. This could be mainly due to the increased awareness among women in the recent years as well as the government scaled up the HIV testing during the past few years, both in terms of increasing the testing facilities across the state and providing capacity of those staff involved in testing. Hence, there is a program need for the about-to-be-married and the newly-married couples to be educated about HIV transmission, the practice of safe sex as well as the use of HIV prevention services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Age at marriage; Married women living with HIV; Timing of HIV testing,"Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; School of Development Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English
"Saxena K., Chakraborty P., Chattarji S.",The same stress has divergent effects on social versus asocial manifestations of anxiety-like behavior over time,2021,Stress,"Stress may lead to augmented anxiety, which may, with time culminate in some form of anxiety disorder. Behavioral alterations related to increased anxiety can be broadly classified into two types–social, affecting interactions between individuals, and self-oriented, affecting the anxious individual only. While a growing body of literature now exists describing the effects of stress-induced anxiety on self-oriented behavior in animal models of anxiety disorders, the effects of such aberrant anxiety on social behavior has largely remained uncharacterized in these models. This study aims to fill this gap in our understanding by examining changes in social behavior following a single 2-hour episode of immobilization stress, which has been shown to cause delayed structural and functional changes in the amygdala. To this end, we examined social behavior, measured as active social interactions, anogenital sniffing, nose-to-nose contacts, allogrooming, actively following and crawling under, as well as self-oriented asocial behavior, manifested as self-grooming and rearing, in adult male rats. Stressed animals showed reduced social interaction 1 day after immobilization stress and this decrease was persistent for at least 10 days after stress. In contrast, individualistic behaviors were impaired only 10 days, but not 1 day later. Together, these results not only show that the same single episode of stress can elicit divergent effects on social and asocial measures of anxiety in the same animal, but also suggest that enhanced social anxiety soon after stress may also serve as an early indicator of its delayed behavioral effects. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anxiety; delayed effect; grooming; PTSD; rearing; social interaction; Stress,"Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India; Centre for Brain Development and Repair, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore, India",English
"Rai R., Rai A.K.",Nature of sex trafficking in India: A geographical perspective,2021,Children and Youth Services Review,"Female trafficking for sexual exploitation (SE) is one of the major problems in India. Young females are particularly vulnerable to this crime. Existing state machinery is somewhat deficient in its tactical and technical doctrines to combat the challenges posed in this regard. The current study attempted to understand the spatiality of female trafficking in India, which can inform combat strategies. We considered a systematic review of published quantitative and qualitative kinds of literature. Potentially relevant articles for systematic review were identified by searching bibliographical databases. A mixed-method was deployed to analyze deemed necessary for inclusion of female trafficking for sexual exploitations. Data were analyzed qualitatively by using thematic analysis and using Arc-GIS to appreciate the data geographically. The results were collated and analyzed concerning fulfilling the key objectives of the review. A large number of children and women trafficked for SE in India. Trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation occurs particularly in poverty-stricken regions and vulnerable populations. Tribal people have mainly been pushed into such activities. Additionally, it has given an opportunity for the enormous potential profits for those syndicates that were set up for organized crimes and independent traffickers. It is the fundamental right of women and children to be protected from any forms of trafficking and to be treated with dignity. Therefore, it requires a comprehensive anti-human trafficking strategy that embedded in a human rights approach since the violation of human rights is both the cause as well as the consequence of human trafficking. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Crime; Human trafficking; India; Prostitution; Sex trafficking; Sexual exploitation,"School of Geography, Gangadhar Meher University, Sambalpur, Odisha, India; PG Department of Geography, Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara, Bihar, India",English
"Abraham A., Ramachandran P.",The welfare implications of transboundary storage and dam ownership on river water trade,2021,Mathematical Social Sciences,"River water trade is a method for reallocating water among riparian states in an efficient and self-enforcing fashion. In this study, we investigate the functioning of river water markets when the upstream state has the ability to build dams. Using a two-agent model, we describe the implications that dam ownership can have on agent welfare as well as on social welfare. We introduce and discuss the concept of strategic storage in river sharing problems, which refers to the withholding of water by the upstream state exclusively for the purpose of trade. We investigate the conditions under which an agent would resort to such a behaviour. We show that having such strategic storage creates a welfare loss for the downstream agent and also results in the loss of social welfare. As an empirical illustration, we study the allocation of the Cauvery river water to agricultural users and municipal users located upstream and downstream of the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dam respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Damming of transboundary river; Market power; River sharing problem,"Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru, India",English
"Hosaka K.R.J., Kang E., Huff J., Shaw S., Duomai S.",Livelihood intervention and mental well-being among women living with HIV in Delhi,2021,AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV,"Poverty-alleviation programmes aimed to improved mental well-being among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in low and middle income countries have underscored the importance of understanding how and why such programmes work. We present findings from a six-month ethnographic process evaluation of Kiran, an economic livelihood programme locally designed to improve mental well-being among women affected by HIV in Delhi, India. In addition to benefits of improved economic standing, we found that supportive relationships cultivated among participants (n = 9) and with providers (n = 3) provided respite from worry about their illness and reframed what was relationally and practically possible in the context of living with HIV. In acquiring marketable craft skills with peers, participants challenged internalized scripts of being socially devalued and regained agency about their abilities to contribute to their community and support their children’s immediate and future needs. We found that the benefits of Kiran weighed less on the direct alleviation of mental distress and more on the instillation of hope for their children.

"Sudhakar R., Veeraiah S., Ganesan P., Balakrishnan K.",Quality of death: The unspoken experiences of patients with advanced cancers in India – An exploratory qualitative study,2021,Psycho-Oncology,"Objective: End-of-life (EOL) care is a developing concept in India, with well-established practices in certain states like Kerala, but not in all the states. As there is a substantial stigma associated with death discussion across the Indian population, the experiences of caregivers of people with advanced cancer have not been explored. Our aim in this study was to explore the experience and perceptions of caregivers of people diagnosed with advanced cancer regarding the quality of the individuals' death. Methods: An exploratory study where the caregivers (n = 108) of advanced cancer patients, who died either during hospitalization or at home, were interviewed to assess quality of death (QOD), using an open-ended question to explore the sufferings of the patients in the final days and caregivers' coping mechanism. Results: Majority of the patients died at home (n = 79, 73.1%). The thematic analysis of the transcripts resulted in seven sub-themes, which were categorized under four major themes, namely ‘bodily discomfort’, ‘psychological experiences’ with the sub-themes resilience and existential distress, ‘awareness of prognoses’ with the sub-themes aware, unaware and conjecture, and ‘carers coping’ with the sub-themes perceived strain and contentment. Conclusion: Patients under EOL care experience physical and psychological suffering, as reported by the caregivers. Efforts must be undertaken to reduce suffering by means of improving focus on and strengthening symptom management and enhancing psychosocial support, for optimally utilizing the available interventions to manage the physical symptoms and to address the psychosocial issues. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",advanced cancer; caregivers and caregiving; end-of-life; pain; prognostic awareness; psycho-oncology; quality of death; quality of life; suffering; terminal illness,"Department of Psycho-Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, India; Department of Medical Oncology, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India",English

Using daily data from November 2018 to June 2020, we use both DY (Diebold & Yilmaz, 2012) and BK (Baruník et al., 2017) to examine the volatility connectedness of returns series. The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Equity and other prices; Fintech; Fourth industrial revolution; Green bonds; Portfolio diversification,"The University of Sydney, Business School, Australia; University of Finance-Marketing, Viet Nam; The University of Adelaide, Business School, Australia; Rajagiri Business School, Rajagiri Valley Campus, Kochi, India",English
"Das P., Paria B., Firdaush S.",Juxtaposing Consumption Poverty and Multidimensional Poverty: A Study in Indian Context,2021,Social Indicators Research,"The present study explores the nature of poverty by considering both consumption and multidimensional approaches and assesses the change in it due to variation in population subgroups and household characteristics in India between 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. We have developed a Multidimensional Poverty Index for India which has the advantage of being comparable with consumption poverty using National Sample Survey Organization data relating to the ‘Level and Pattern of Consumer Expenditure’ of the latest two rounds. Our analysis shows a significant reduction in consumption poverty as well as multidimensional poverty. Multidimensional poverty has reduced significantly for both consumption poor and non-poor but the reduction has not been uniform across subgroups and household characteristics. Satisfactorily, the reduction was faster among the poorer subgroups. Notwithstanding this trend, urban location, upper strata of social caste, literate head, self- or regular employment and higher level of benefits from Public Distribution System (PDS) have a favorable impact on the nature of poverty. The study strongly recommends the incorporation of the multidimensional approach along with the consumption approach to measure poverty which has high policy relevance. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Consumption poverty; Dimensional deprivation; India; Multidimensional poverty; Nature of poverty; PDS,"Department of Economics, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, West Bengal, India",English
"Singh S.K., Sharma S.K., Vishwakarma D.",Covariates of Multiplicity of High-Risk Sexual Behavior Among Men in India: Evidence from the Latest Indian Demographic and Health Survey,2021,Archives of Sexual Behavior,"Modern Indian society has witnessed rapid sociocultural transformation where loosening of cultural values is observed at all levels. In the era of transition, traditional norms and values are changing where young male individuals are found to be associated with high-risk multi-partner sexual behavior. Findings are based on a nationally representative sample of 45,231 and 65,704 men aged 15–54 during the period 2005–2006 and 2015–2016, respectively. The burden of high-risk sexual behaviors among men aged 15–54 years in India over the last decade remains disproportionately higher among younger, unmarried, and urban men, who are mainly from economically better-off households. Despite tremendous efforts of the government of India as well as various state governments in condom promotion as part of the HIV/AIDS prevention program, the improvements in condom use over the last decade are not impressive as it has not yet reached the desired threshold level. The disparities in high-risk sexual behavior among men aged 15–54 years, coming from rich and poor households, have narrowed. The findings of the study also underline an apparent paradox in the relationship between knowledge of HIV/AIDS and indulgence in high-risk sexual behavior and adopting safe sexual practices. It is recommended that all the HIV prevention programs in India should promote the concept of men as the responsible sexual partner. This concept may be promoted among young and unmarried men by reinforcing the shift from violence to respect and projecting the condom as a sexual stimulus rather than a means of disease prevention. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Condom use; High-risk sexual behavior; India; Men; Socioeconomic inequality,"Department of Mathematical Demography and Statistics, International Institute for Population Sciences, Govandi Station Road, Deonar, Mumbai, 400088, India",English
"Gangopadhyay D., Nielsen R.B., Zahirovic-Herbert V.",Methodology and Axiomatic Characterization of a Multidimensional and Fuzzy Measure of Deprivation,2021,Social Indicators Research,"This article proposes a general methodology to measure multidimensional deprivation in a fuzzy setup. Each dimension comprises multiple dimensional attributes. The methodology is developed in a flexible manner to incorporate any theoretical construct of wellbeing. The new fuzzy membership functions proposed in the method combines the absolute and relative notions of deprivation and take the functional form of normalized and weighted deprivation gaps. A new weight structure is proposed for aggregations within and across the dimensions. Three forms of deprivation indices are discussed: the headcount ratio, the adjusted deprivation index, and the deprivation index. A unified axiomatic framework is discussed for the multidimensional and fuzzy measures of deprivation. Various desired axiomatic properties of the fuzzy membership functions are included as precursory axioms in the framework. The proposed measure satisfies a majority of the desirable axioms. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Absolute and relative; Axioms; Deprivation measure; Distribution sensitive; Fuzzy; Multidimensional,"Department of Financial Planning, Housing, and Consumer Economics, University of Georgia, 213 Dawson Hall, 305 Sanford Dr., Athens, GA  30602, United States; Data Quality Assurance Division, National Statistical Office, Government of India, Mahalanobis Bhavan, 164 G.

"Bahl S., Sharma A.",Education–Occupation Mismatch and Dispersion in Returns to Education: Evidence from India,2021,Social Indicators Research,"Using a national level sample survey on labour market in India, we analyze the role of education–occupation (mis-)match (EOM) in explaining within-group dispersion in returns to education. Applying a double sample selection bias correction and Mincerian quantile wage regression estimation, the analysis reveals interesting findings. First, on average, overeducated workers suffer a wage penalty of 7% and undereducated workers do not receive a wage reward as compared to their adequately educated counterparts. Second, the inclusion of match status reduces within-education group dispersion in returns. The finding highlights that ignoring EOM and thus, adopting a restrictive view of similarity across workers may lead to overestimation of the within-education group dispersion in returns. This study argues for focusing on EOM to increase both pecuniary and social benefits of education in terms of productivity gains and wages as well as to reduce wage dispersion. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Dispersion in returns to education; Education–occupation mismatch; India; Quantile regression; Wage dispersion,"Indian Institute of Management Indore, Rau-Pithampur Road, Prabandh Shikhar, Indore, M.P  453556, India",English

Perceived social support influences QOL in People Living with HIV (PLHIV), though this has not been studied well in India. PLHIV were assessed for Social Support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and QOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. The factors impacting social support and its effect of on QOL were analysed. Amongst the 109 study subjects, 62 (56.9%) were men, 47 (43.1%) were women, mean age was 35 ± 7.5 years, 85.3% had WHO stage 1 disease and 80 (73.4%) were receiving ART. Only 43.1% subjects perceived high overall social support. Social support (from family/friends/others) was associated positively with physical functioning (p = 0.001), social and cognitive functioning (p = 0.000) and significantly inversely associated with depression (p = 0.002). Higher perceived social support was seen to correlate with higher CD4 count (Peak, Nadir and Current; p < 0.05) and better adherence (p = 0.003). It is concluded that social support, including support from beyond family, have a significant impact on clinical endpoints and QOL in PLHIV. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",depression; family support; HIV; Quality of life; social support,"ART Center, Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, India",English
Kanwar P.,Pubertal timing and externalizing problem behaviours in adolescents: The influence of perceived parental attachments,2021,European Journal of Developmental Psychology,"Pubertal timing carries social as well as psychological implications. It is observed that adolescents rely upon their families, friends and other social circles for learning important skills that help them to cope with the pressures they face during the pubertal transition towards adulthood successfully. Since behavioural response to puberty also depends on the different social context in which it occurs, an effort is made to understand role of parent–adolescent attachment in comprehending pubertal timing effects on problem behaviours of adolescents under the premise of contextual amplification model. For this purpose, cross-sectional data consisting of 772 adolescents (age 11–15 years) were taken. Each participant completed the Pubertal Developmental Scale, Youth Self Report and Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. Results highlight early maturing adolescents with insecure perceived parental attachments to have higher scores on externalizing problems in comparison to their on-time and late maturing peers. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that stressful biological and social changes inherent in pubertal development elicits certain behavioural responses in adolescents that become more pronounced in those who lack supportive parental structures that help them to negotiate the demands of their new status with better adjustment. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adolescents; externalizing problem behaviours; perceived parental attachment; Pubertal timing,"Department of psychology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India",English

Extant research has examined the adoption of smart fitness wearables, with limited attention paid to continuance intention. The current study attempts to investigate users’ continuance intentions of using smart fitness wearables by combining expectation confirmation theory and social comparison theory. In particular, this paper extends the expectation confirmation model by adding perceived health outcomes and social comparison tendency to understand the continuance intention of smart fitness variables. The model explains 72.8% of continuance intention, and the findings reveal that perceived health outcome and users’ satisfaction predict continuance intention leading to intention to recommend. Furthermore, the findings confirm the positive impact of social comparison tendency on perceived health outcome and users’ satisfaction. Users’ satisfaction is influenced by perceived usefulness, confirmation, perceived health outcome and social comparison tendency. Our study confirms that mere post-adoption perceived usefulness does not guarantee continuance intention, unless the perceived health outcomes are achieved. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",continuance intention; expectation confirmation model; health outcomes; Smart fitness wearables; social comparison,"SHTM, Faculty of Business Studies, University of Jammu, Jammu, India; Department of Management Studies, National Institute of Technology, Hamiprur, India; IBS, IFHE University, Hyderabad, India; School of Business Studies, Central University of Jammu, Jammu, India",English

Based on Social Representations Theory, as well as the psychosocial consequences of pandemics and crises, we evaluate the perceptions of severity and risks, the agreement with different SRs, and participants’ Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA). Different sets of beliefs are discussed as SRs, together with their prevalence and association with contextual variables. Results show that severity and risk perceptions were associated with different SRs of the pandemic. Specifically, those focused on Emerging Externalizing zoonotic and ecological factors (the virus is due to Chinese unhygienic habits and the overexploitation of the planet), Polemic Conspiracies (the virus is a weapon), views of Elite and Mass Villains (the elites deceive us and profit with the pandemic), and Personal Responsibility (the neglectful deserves contagion) during the pandemic. Furthermore, most of the SRs are anchored in SDO and, more strongly, in RWA orientations. Additional meta-analyses and multi-level regressions show that the effects are replicated in most geographical areas and that risk perception was a consistent explanatory variable, even after controlling for demographics and ‘real risk’ (i.e., actual numbers of contagion and death). Results suggest that, while coping with and making sense of the pandemic, authoritarian subjects agree with SR that feed a sense of social control and legitimize outgroup derogation, and support punishment of ingroup low-status deviants. © 2020.

A sample of 300 participants (243 men and 57 women; mean age: 56.1 years) was recruited into three groups. One group received a unique psycho-educational intervention called Programme for Affective and Cognitive Education (PACE), the second group was given a Relaxation intervention (Guided Imagery), and the third group had only standard medical treatment (Control). The PACE and Relaxation interventions were administered to patients alongside standard treatment a day before CABG as well as a day before discharge from hospital. Prognosis was assessed six weeks after discharge. Psychological distress was measured at baseline, week after discharge, and six weeks after discharge. Analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of groups on prognosis and a significant group × time interaction for psychological distress. The highest prognosis after CABG and the lowest psychological dis-r tress were found in the PACE group. Path analyses indicated that the PACE and Relaxation interventions negatively impacted psychological distress which in turn predicted higher prognosis. Only the PACE intervention additionally had a positive direct impact on prognosis. Both psychosocial interventions helped enhance the prognosis of patients after CABG primarily by reducing psychological distress. PACE emerged as a more effective intervention than Relaxation. © Copyright: the Author(s), 2020",Coronary artery bypass grafting; Coronary artery disease; Intervention; Prognosis; Psychological distress,"Freelance Psychologist, University of Hyderabad, India; Centre for Health Psychology, University of Hyderabad, India",English
Matta G.,Science communication as a preventative tool in the COVID19 pandemic,2020,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,"Humans have witnessed epidemics and pandemics periodically throughout history. Often, such infectious outbreaks have resulted in entire civilisations struggling against possible extinction. Despite recent clinical advancements and technological developments, issues of neglected sustainability and lax health hygiene practices, among others, have provided a context for the emergence of the COVID19 pandemic. Against such a backdrop, scientific communication using diversified tools could play a significant role in efforts towards preparedness and control, as well as the initiation of immediate remedial measures in the fight against epidemics and pandemics. These tools could help to increase understanding of the scientific solutions to minimise the outbreaks of infectious diseases, thereby strengthening societal immunity. This paper considers the history of epidemics/pandemics to draw attention to their occurrence, effects and potential impacts on human societies. In addition, it defines the major factors underpinning the various infectious outbreaks over the last three decades. Constructive preparation and preventative stages for authorities, scientists and researchers to check and diminish the impact of epidemics and pandemics during and post-outbreak are suggested while focusing on the need for science communication in the healthcare system. The paper also reviews recent empirical studies and WHO guidelines. Communication through appropriate communicators may help cut through the noise, share facts and boost confidence in science and governance. The impact of science communication on the interplay between government–expert–public or society could help promote positive behavioural change as well as overcome linguistic barriers. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"Hydrological Research Lab., Department of Zoology and Environmental Science, Gurukula Kangri (Deemed to be University), Haridwar, Uttarakhand  249404, India",English

Such burden can double in areas that are affected by violence or protracted conflict. People residing in protracted conflict area face numerous challenges due to their intermittent exposure to traumatic events. Women are often the worst sufferers due to several reasons. Manipur, India has witnessed conflict since several decades and both developmental and humanitarian organizations categorize the nature of conflict in Manipur as protracted. The nature of the conflict in Manipur is complex due to involvement of several actors. This paper explores mental health burden of women living in protracted conflict area of Manipur, India. This quantitative study employs a cross-sectional interview-based survey to understand mental health burden on a randomly selected sample of 666 respondents, of whom, 359 were women (53.9%). The mental health burden was assessed through four dimensions namely affective, behavioural, cognitive, and physiological. The analysis explored mental health burden of women in comparison to men. While, there was no significant gender difference in exposure or experience of conflict, women reported significantly higher mental health burden as compared to men, both overall as well as on each dimension. This study validates the results of other studies that report higher mental health burden in conflict areas.

The obtained quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent samples t test, Pearson’s correlation and standard multiple regression. A significant positive relationship between all the three variables, viz. coping competence, mindfulness and well-being was found. Multiple regression analyses indicated that both the variables-coping competence and mindfulness (together as a model) predicted well-being but did not make significant individual contributions in predicting well-being. The implications and limitations of the study are discussed. © 2020, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Adolescents; Coping competence; Correlational design; Mindfulness; Well-being,"Centre for Health Psychology, University of Hyderabad, Central University, Prof C.R.

"Gala J., Ghadiyali N.N.",Romantic Memes and Beliefs: Influence on Relationship Satisfaction,2020,Psychological Studies,"The study aims to understand the influence of romantic memes and beliefs on relationship satisfaction. Beliefs which lead to undesirable outcomes in the relationship are defined as “toxic beliefs”. As media plays an important role in socializing young people, the popular love memes produced by media nurtures the beliefs of young people. The current experimental study on emerging adults (N = 90) seeks to understand the influence of short-term exposure (Cognitive Priming) of romantic memes on romantic beliefs and relationship satisfaction of emerging adults. Participants of experimental group 1 (n = 30) and experimental group 2 (n = 30) were primed with different types of memes (a) popular/normative memes (b) counter-intuitive/off-beat memes followed by the administration of tools assessing romantic beliefs and relationship satisfaction. Participants (n = 30) of control group were only assessed on romantic beliefs and relationship satisfaction. Broadly, the study hypothesized that (a) there will be influence of priming resulting in significant differences on beliefs and satisfaction scores in experimental group 1 and experimental group 2 as well as control group and experimental group 2. (b) There will be influence of priming resulting in no significant differences on beliefs and satisfaction scores in experimental group 1 and control group. Results of the study suggest that there is an influence of priming romantic memes only in the domain of popular beliefs in relationship beliefs scale and overall there is no influence of priming on romantic beliefs and relationship satisfaction across the groups. The current study provides useful information about how memes influence young people, and discusses the importance of evaluating memes carefully before subscribing to any meme. © 2020, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Media; Priming and relationship satisfaction; Romantic beliefs; Romantic memes,"Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Faculty of Family and Community Sciences, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara, Fatehgunj, Baroda  350002, India",English
"Kathuria T., Pandya A.K.","Listen, I am too responsible! Effect of schooling on sense of trust, responsibility and belongingness to the community of children working on the street in Chandigarh City, India",2020,Children and Youth Services Review,"Children working on the street are the most vulnerable and are at greater risk of exploitation. Therefore, building the strong ties between the school, family and community of the child can protect the child from various risks and thus can provide opportunities for healthy development. Schooling is instrumental in promoting sense of trust, responsbility towards community and moral values of children, however, in this domain, much of the research was done with youth, not with adolescents. The present study examined sense of trust, responsibility towards community and moral values of school going as well non-school going children (between 13 and 16 years of age) who were living with their parents in slums and spending most of their time working on the streets of Chandigarh city, India. Results revealed that school has emerged as an agency promoting a child's sense of belongingness (F = 4.15, p < .05), school (F = 15.02, p < .001) & family adjustment (F = 6.17, p < .01). Although trust and responsibility toward community was not statistically significant, the mean value of them was higher among school-going children (M = 12.80, ± 2.57) compared to non-school going working children (M = 11.04, ± 4.44). The present study highlights statistically significant positive outcomes of schooling on child's sense of belongingness and adjustment in school as well as with family. Benefits of schooling can be extended through existing Government programs particularly Integrated Child Protection Scheme and Sarva Siksha Abhiyan by linking working children on the street with the schools. At the same time, efforts should be directed towards educating parents or guardians on the importance of schooling; encourage them to send their children to the school and actively participate in children's education. Future research on large sample would be insightful. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",India; Moral values; Schooling; Street children; Working children,"Independent Researcher, United States; Health Psychologist & Scientist D, Indian Institute of Public Health GandhinagarGujarat, India",English

Most of the studies in India related to anaemia among children are related to children aged 6–59 months. Therefore, this study intends to examine anaemia among children aged 5–9 years of age using a recent nationally representative sample survey ‘Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS).’ CNNS is a cross-sectional, household face to face survey. The total sample size for this study was 14,664 children who had anaemia. Anaemia among children aged 5–9 was the outcome variable for this study. The anemia level among children was categorized as 1 if haemoglobin level less than 11.5 g/dl (anemic) and 0 otherwise. The explanatory variables were categorized into three groups indicating children's characteristics, maternal characteristics, and household's characteristics. The binary logistic regression analysis had been performed to find out the predictors of anaemia among children aged 5–9 years in India. Nearly one-fourth (23.1%) and one-fifth (21.1%) of the children with low level of Vitamin A and Vitamin B12 were anaemic. Nearly one-fourth of the children (23.5) aged 5–9 years in India had anaemia The prevalence of anaemia among children was as low as 3.1 percent in Kerala and as high as 41.1 percent in Tripura. The results confirmed that a low level of folate, zinc, and vitamin A were associated with a high level of anaemia among children. Higher mother's education status was accompanied by a low level of anaemia among children. The alarming level of anaemia among children calls for immediate attention in terms of detailed study of risk factors, effective policy, and timely intervention. Anaemia among children aged 5–9 years requires investments in mother's education and socioeconomic status along with improvements in micronutrient intake and overall nutritional wellbeing of the children. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Anaemia; Children; India; Risk factors; Vitamin A,"Department of Community Medicine, Maharishi Markandeshwar Medical College & Hospital, Maharishi Markandeshwar University, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India; Department of Population Policies and Programmes, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India; Department of Public Health and Mortality Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India; Centre for the Study of Regional Development, School of Social Sciences 3, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India; Department of Mathematical Demography and Statistics, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India",English

Multipath TCP supports multiple paths for a single routing session and ensures proper utilization of bandwidth over all available links. As rise in number of nodes in data center is frequent and drastic, scalability issue limits the performance of many existing techniques. Segment Routing is vibrant in reducing scalability disputes and routing overhead. Segment routing approach combined with MPTCP traffic result in efficient routing approach. The downfall of the link capacity due to drastic incoming traffic remains as a major concern in data center network which enforces preventing link energy depletion due to high network traffic. Our proposed work, segment routing based energy aware routing approach for software defined data center aims to achieve throughput maximization through preserving link residual capacity and proper utilization of links. As well, our approach shows a decrease in length of segment label stack with respect to maximum segment label depth. Analysis is done by comparing the executions of other existing approaches in a single-controller environment with our energy-aware routing approach in a distributed environment. Distributed controller setup prevents network from single point of failure. It helps to prevent controller overhead and provides improved network performance through throughput. © 2020",Data Center Network (DCN); Multipath TCP (MPTCP); Open Daylight (ODL); Segment Label Stack (SLS); Segment Routing (SR); Software Defined Data Center (SDDC); Software Defined Network (SDN),"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education (KARE), Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, FST, ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education, Hyderabad, India; Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi, India; Department of Computer Applications, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, India",English

"Singh J., Verma R., Raghav R., Sarkar S., Sood M., Jain R.",Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls: A comparative study,2020,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Background: Abnormalities in brain development and plasticity have been associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in schizophrenia is the recent area of interest because it regulates neurogenesis. The current study aimed to assess and compare serum BDNF levels between first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, and evaluate its correlation with the socio-demographic and clinical variables. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional comparative study for the assessment of serum BDNF levels between patients with first-episode schizophrenia (N=50) and healthy controls (N-50) conducted in the Department of Psychiatry at a tertiary care public hospital attached to a medical school in North India. Participants were assessed for the socio-demographic parameters, nicotine dependence, and clinical details using structured scales. Serum BDNF level estimated using the sandwich ELISA technique. The comparison between the groups was done by using a Student t-test or chi-square test. Spearman correlation was performed between mean BDNF scores and demographic or illness variables in both first-episode schizophrenia and healthy control groups. Results: There was a significantly lower mean score of total serum BDNF levels in first-episode schizophrenia patients as compared to controls (8.44 ± 1.54 vs 10.44 ± 2.04; t = 5.52, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.28-2.71). The total FTND scores for smokeless tobacco use were negatively correlated to BDNF levels among healthy controls (r=-0.30, p=0.03) as well as in the first-episode schizophrenia group (r=-0.32, p= 0.04). None of the other illness-related variables were correlated to serum BDNF values in the first episode schizophrenia group. Conclusion: Individuals with first-episode schizophrenia have lower serum BDNF levels than healthy controls. The illness-related factors such as duration of untreated psychosis or psychopathology were not correlated with BDNF levels. Thus abnormal signaling of BDNF can lead to abnormal brain functioning which can make an individual more susceptible to schizophrenia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Antipsychotics; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; First episode schizophrenia; Neurodevelopment; Smoking,"National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC), Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India",English
"Shah Z., Pal P., Pal G.K., Papa D., Bharadwaj B.",Assessment of the association of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity with depressive symptoms and stress experienced by women in pregnancy,2020,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background: Pregnancy is a unique physiological state with systemic changes including cardiovascular, autonomic, hemodynamic and psychological. Increase in incidence of stress and depression in antenatal period has been reported. Autonomic changes in pregnancy and its dysfunction in depression are well documented. However, there is lack of evidence associating cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction to stress and depressed mood in pregnant women. Methods: In this correlation study, we assessed cardiovascular autonomic functions of 172 pregnant women using heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). The Edinburg postnatal depression scale (EPDS) was used to evaluate depressive symptoms and perceived stress scale (PSS) was used to assess stress. The HRV and BRS parameters were correlated with EPDS and PSS. Multiple regression analysis was performed for EPDS and PSS individually to study their association with cardiac autonomic functions(CAF). Results: HRV and BRS were well correlated to EPDS and PSS scores. The depression and stress were found to be significantly associated to autonomic dysfunctions as increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity. Among various CAF parameters, LF:HF ratio and BRS were found to be significantly associated with depression and stress among these women. Conclusion: LF:HF ratio and BRS may be associated with depression during antenatal period. The depression in antenatal period may add on to cardiovascular risk in expecting mothers. © 2020",Baroreflex sensitivity; Depressive symptoms; Heart rate variability; Pregnancy; Stress,"Department of Physiology, JIPMER, Puducherry, 605006, India; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, JIPMER, Puducherry, India; Department of Psychiatry, JIPMER, Puducherry, India",English

Psychiatric rehabilitative models are individual-centric, focusing on individual level skills (emotional, social, self-management and vocational) and development to enhance successful community reintegration. If the entire family is considered to be a unit for rehabilitation, i.e. family centric rehabilitation, the possibility of empowering the family to function effectively is higher despite the illness. The objective of the case study is to conceptualize the framework ‘Family centric Rehabilitation’. Methods: Case study design. Results: Family centric rehabilitation can be conceptualized as ‘a process that facilitates families, dysfunctional due to PMI, to reach their optimal level of independent functioning by harnessing resources available within the community’. Family centric rehabilitation focuses on enhancing global functioning of the “family unit”, in essence all members, rather than just the PMI. Strategies deployed include concurrently addressing and minimizing anticipated challenges across domains including medical, psychosocial, vocational as well as economic, thereby aiding in recovery of the family unit as a whole. Conclusions: Family centric rehabilitation is an important culture specific concept that aims to provide optimal level of functioning of all family members and can contribute to the family achieving self-sustenance, a sense of autonomy and empowerment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Family centric; Family rehabilitation; Mental illness; Psychiatric rehabilitation,"Department of Psychiatric Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, 560029, India; Department of Psychiatric Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, 560029, India; Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, 560029, India; District Mental Health Programme, Belagum, 590001, India",English

This study aims to reveal the “safe game” tactics that the bullies use to chase targets like a predator chases his prey. Design/methodology/approach: The study explores various manifestations of academic bullying by analyzing the victimization experiences of women faculty in academic institutions. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews and informal discussions to explore the victimization episodes in detail. Findings: The analysis indicates a set of common manifestations framed by bullies in academia to create a favorable environment for bullying. These manifestations often play out in a sequence. Initially, the targets are overloaded with work to portray the victims as incapable and less competent. Then, the bullies lodge many formal complaints with the help of their supporters. Finally, they create an environment of silence by threatening them for their responses against bullying. Originality/value: This paper is supported by previous research in this area and progresses by exploring the experiences of the victims in academics to find a common sequence in the mistreatment they suffer. The study concludes by showing unexplored areas in research on workplace bullying in the academic sector and provides a foundation for further research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Academia bullying; Manifestations of bullying; Sequence of manifestations; Thematic analysis; Women as the target; Workplace bullying,"School of Management Studies, Cochin University of Science and TechnologyKochi, India",English

However, the literature on the Dark Triad traits relies mostly on samples from English-speaking (i.e., Westernized) countries. We broadened the scope of this literature by sampling from a wider array of countries. Method: We drew on data from 49 countries (N = 11,723; 65.8% female; AgeMean = 21.53) to examine how an extensive net of country-level variables in economic status (e.g., Human Development Index), social relations (e.g., gender equality), political orientations (e.g., democracy), and cultural values (e.g., embeddedness) relate to country-level rates of the Dark Triad traits, as well as variance in the magnitude of sex differences in them. Results: Narcissism was especially sensitive to country-level variables. Countries with more embedded and hierarchical cultural systems were more narcissistic. Also, sex differences in narcissism were larger in more developed societies: Women were less likely to be narcissistic in developed (vs. less developed) countries. Conclusions: We discuss the results based on evolutionary and social role models of personality and sex differences. That higher country-level narcissism was more common in less developed countries, whereas sex differences in narcissism were larger in more developed countries, is more consistent with evolutionary than social role models. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cross-cultural; cultural values; Dark Triad; Machiavellianism; narcissism; psychopathy,"University of Padova, Padua, Italy; Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University, Warsaw, Poland; University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States; University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom; Monash Business School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands; Ghent University, Gent, Belgium; University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa; Padjadjaran University, Bandung, Indonesia; University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; University of Mauritius, Moka, Mauritius; University of Oradea, Oradea, Romania; International Balkan University, Skopje, North Macedonia; Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden; Thammasat University, Bangkok, Thailand; Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico, Mexico; New Bulgarian University, Sofya, Bulgaria; Al-Azhar University-Gaza, Gaza, Palestine; Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), CIS-IUL, Lisboa, Portugal; Menoufia University, Al-Minufya, Egypt; Al-Jouf University in Saudi Arabia, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia; Federal University of Paraiba, Paraiba, Brazil; Montpelier Business School, Montpelier, France; Daugavpils University, Daugavpils, Latvia; Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; University of Graz, Graz, Austria; Karnatak University, Dharwad, Karnataka, India; Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia; Czech Academy of Sciences, Praha, Czech Republic; International University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina; ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Lingnan Normal University, Lingnan, China; Tallinn University, Talinn, Estonia; Mother Teresa University, Skopje, North Macedonia; Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador, Ambato, Ecuador; Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom; National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation; Nagoya University of Commerce and Business School, Nagoya, Japan; Institute for Criminological and Sociological Research, Belgrade, Serbia; Universidad de Ciencias y Humanidades, Lima, Peru; Independent Researcher, Islamabad, Pakistan; S.

"Singh P., Pattanaik F.","Unfolding unpaid domestic work in India: women’s constraints, choices, and career",2020,Palgrave Communications,"Unpaid domestic work is an important aspect of productive activities and an indispensable factor that contributes to the well-being of household and economy. However, the predominance of women in domestic work and keeping them out of ‘economic activities’ put unpaid domestic work under the shadow of invisibility, outside the production boundaries, and further outside the purview of economic policy. The nature of women’s work has endured substantial alterations during the neo-liberal paradigm of Indian economy, and women’s participation in the labor force and workforce has declined significantly. To understand the status of women in the labor market, it is necessary to comprehend the nature of their unpaid work, which has significant impact on their work participation rate in the economy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the magnitude and factors that influence the unpaid domestic work status of women in India. The findings of this study reveal that the intensity to be engaged in domestic work is high among women who are less educated and belong to the lower wealth quintile in society. Women are engaged in unpaid domestic work because of three factors—Constraints (social and religious), Choices (failure of market and states to provide essential provisioning), and Career (low opportunity cost of unpaid work in the market). Therefore, a holistical approach within the broader context of household, state, market, and society through a macro, meso, and micro interconnects has to be considered for changing women’s status in the economy. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand  247667, India",English
"Chakravarty S.R., Mitra M., Mutuswami S., Pal R.",On the probability ratio index as a measure of electoral competition,2020,Palgrave Communications,"This paper deals with the fundamental issue of quantifying the degree of competitiveness underlying an election in a society. That is, given the vote shares of competing political parties in the election one needs to arrive at a representative metric of electoral competition. The vote share of a party represents its influence on the outcome of the election. A summary measure of differences of such influences across parties, aggregated in an unambiguous way, is an index of electoral competitiveness. The literature contains several such indices. Implicit under the choice of an index is a set of properties that the index satisfies. A highly attractive feature of the probability ratio index we suggest in this article, as a summary measure of electoral competition, is its suitability for making comparisons of competitiveness across elections with different number of parties. The probability ratio index is simply the ratio between the probabilities that the two voters drawn at random with (without) replacement have voted for different parties under actual vote shares across the competing parties and under equal vote shares across them. The comparability feature of the probability ratio index can be maintained without sacrificing any nice characteristic expected from an electoral competition measure. The probability ratio index is inversely related to the well-known Herfindahl–Hirschman concentration index that indicates dominance of large parties, directly related to the fractionalization index, which indicates how vote shares are split among the parties, and also inversely related to the squared coefficient of variation, a highly popular measure of inequality. It is argued explicitly how the new index can be applied to measure competitiveness for true data. Simple examples are used to demonstrate why probability ratio index has a comparative advantage over some other well-known indices, particularly, in terms of cross-election comparability. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"Economic Research Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India; Economics Division, School of Business, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom; Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai, India",English

It consists of three anchored concepts, namely, interest, creation, and habit. This paper presents the third anchored concept habit as well as the habit loop. IDC theory assumes that learners, when driven by interest, can be engaged in knowledge creation. Furthermore, by repeating such process in their daily learning routines, learners will form interest-driven creation habits. The habit loop, the process of building such a habit, consists of three component concepts—cuing environment, routine, and harmony. The cuing environment is a habit trigger that tells the students’ brain to get prepared and go into an automatic mode, letting a learning behavior unfold. Routine refers to the behavioral patterns the students repeat most often, literally etched into their neural pathways. Harmony refers to the affective outcome of the routine activity as well as the integration or stabilization of habits; that is, through the routine behavior and action, students may feel that their needs get fulfilled, feel satisfied, and experience inner peace. It is our hope that such habitual behavior of creating knowledge can be sustained so long that students ultimately become lifelong interest-driven creators. This paper focuses on the description of the three components of the habit loop and discusses how these components are related to the interest loop and the creation loop in supporting learners in developing their interest-driven creation capability. © 2020, The Author(s).",Habit loop; Interest-driven creator (IDC) theory; Learning habit,"National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan; Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China; Universiti Putra Malaysia, Seri Kembangan, Malaysia; Charles Darwin University, Casuarina, Australia; Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea; Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India; East China Normal University, Shanghai, China",English

However, emotional support for raising children with ASD is not always readily available and/or carefully considered. Interventions that offer psychological support using body-based creative approaches to psychotherapy such as Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP) are scarce; research in this field is equally limited. In this study, the lived experiences of parents of children with ASD who participated in six DMP sessions were analysed from a hermeneutic phenomenology perspective. Three main categories and several sub-themes were identified: (a) the journey (6 themes); (b) therapeutic factors and contextual resources (10 themes); (c) general and specific perceived outcomes of DMP (11 themes). Integrating all these themes and considering relevant literature, a summary of the process and outcomes of DMP for resilience enhancement in parents of children with ASD was developed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Autism spectrum disorder; Coping strategies; Dance movement psychotherapy; Parenting stress; Resilience enhancement,"Research Centre for Arts and Wellbeing, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk, United Kingdom; Composite Regional Centre for Skill Development, Rehabilitation and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Davangere, Karnataka, India",English

Heartfulness is a popular meditation technique that includes in its repertoire, a unique passive form of meditation. We carried out a pilot study recruiting male heartfulness meditators (proficient n = 24, with 6–28 years of meditation experience; novice n = 24, 5 to 16 months of experience) and subsequently recruited matched controls (n = 15). We examined well-being, and carried out high-density EEG recordings to examine indices of meditation and cognition in these groups. Well-being scores were significantly higher for the proficient meditators as compared to novice and intermediate for the controls. We did not find any group differences in cognitive processing. During meditation, enhanced occipital gamma was found in proficient meditators as compared to controls.

A comparative survival analysis,2020,Children and Youth Services Review,"Infant mortality rate (IMR) and under five mortality rate (U5MR) are vital indicators of the health of a population. Included in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they are, together with health and nutrition status, considered significant indicators of child well-being. In India, during the period 1990 to 2015, female IMR declined from 81 to 39 deaths per 1000 live births, while male IMR declined from 78 to 35. Further decline was reported by SRS 2018 (Female IMR 33, Male IMR 32). However, the female-male gap in IMR continues to persist. The aim of the present study is to assess the gender disparities in and the risk of infant and under five mortality in India. The study used data from the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015–16). The study revealed that the risk of under-five mortality was higher among males. The pattern of sex differences in infant mortality appears to be the same across India, while that of under-five mortality shows slight differences among males and females. The findings of this study suggest that though socioeconomic characteristics appear to significantly influence infant mortality, sex differences in infant mortality are not influenced by these factors.

"Dar A.A., Deb S.",Psychological distress among young adults exposed to armed conflict in Kashmir,2020,Children and Youth Services Review,"Aim: The broad objective of the present study was to examine the psychological distress among young adult college and university students exposed to traumatic and stressful events of armed conflict in Kashmir, India and its association with background variables. Methods: This study followed a cross-sectional research design. Data was collected from 693 college and university students by using a Semi-Structured Questionnaire and Mental Health Inventory (MHI-18). Results: Findings disclosed that being a male and low monthly family income were significantly associated with higher rates of anxiety and depression. Further, data revealed that low monthly family income and living in rural areas were significantly associated with increased loss of behavioral control. Rural places of residence, affected by conflict and maternal educational backwardness, were significantly associated with higher rates of anxiety. Qualitative data regarding intra-family relationships were perceived to be disturbing by one-third of the youth. At the same time, continuous conflict had an adverse effect on mental health as disclosed by a large number of participants. Conclusion: The study recommends mental health support services for Kashmiri students through institution as well as community-based approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Anxiety; Depression; Kashmir conflict; Mental health; Trauma,"Department of Applied Psychology, Pondicherry University, Puducherry, 605014, India",English

Methods: This assessor-blinded randomized control trial included 25 patients (either sex; 18–65 years) meeting ICD-10 criteria for severe depression (bipolar or unipolar). Patients received either ECT (n = 13) or intravenous infusions of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg over 45 min; n = 12) for six alternate day sessions over a period of two weeks. Severity of depression was assessed at baseline and on every alternate day of intervention using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and self-reported Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Baseline socio-demographic and clinical variables including HDRS (ECT: 25.15±6.58; Ketamine: 23.33±4.05, p = 0.418) and BDI (ECT: 37.07±6.58; Ketamine: 33.33±9.29; p = 0.254) were comparable. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that ECT patients showed significantly greater reduction in HDRS (group*time interaction effect; F = 4.79; p<0.001) and BDI scores (group*time interaction effect; F = 3.83; p<0.01). ECT patients had higher response rate than ketamine patients [HDRS: ECT- 13/13(100%) vs ketamine- 8/12 (66.70%); p = 0.04]. This was true for remission as well [ECT- 12/13(92.30%) vs ketamine- 6/12(50%), p = 0.030; both HDRS and BDI]. Performance on Digit Symbol Substitution Test (as part of the Battery for ECT-Related Cognitive Deficits scale) significantly improved in ketamine patients (p = 0.02) while that in ECT patients worsened non significantly (p = 0.30). Limitations: Relatively small sample size; higher proportion of dropouts in the Ketamine arm. Conclusion: This study favoured ECT over ketamine for a better efficacy over six treatment sessions in severe depression. The results need to be replicated in larger studies.

"Dash T., Kar B.R.",Behavioural and ERP correlates of bilingual language control and general-purpose inhibitory control predicted by L1 and L2 proficiency,2020,Journal of Neurolinguistics,"Cognitive control is the ability to adapt flexibly to current demands by promoting task-relevant information in the face of interference, and this has been asserted as an advantage with bilinguals. Bilingual language control and general-purpose cognitive control are discussed in the literature using different types of stimuli, cognitive tasks, component processes (selection, interference, inhibition, switching) and groups (bilingual vs. monolingual; high proficient vs. low proficient bilingual). The present study was designed to investigate the neurocognitive correlates of inhibitory control with linguistic (i.e., words) and nonlinguistic (i.e., line drawings of objects) stimuli in Hindi-English bilingual adults. We conducted the behavioural experiment first to establish the linguistic version of identity negative priming paradigm followed by the Event-related potential (ERP) experiment using the linguistic and nonlinguistic negative priming task. Results show the presence of inhibition effect using mean reaction times as well as ERP data while comparing the control and ignored repetition conditions, and this pattern varied with different stimuli – linguistic vs. nonlinguistic. Thus, the current study suggests that bilingual language control is not entirely subsidiary to general-purpose cognitive control and shows differences based on the stimulus type. Also, proficiency in L1 and L2 differentially predicts performance on the nonlinguistic and linguistic negative priming paradigm, respectively. These results are indicative of a dynamic cognitive control system associated with bilingualism, which varies as a function of stimulus type as well as language proficiency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bilingual language control; Bilingualism; Event-related potential; General-purpose cognitive control; Inhibitory control; Language proficiency; Negative priming paradigm,"Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Allahabad, Allahabad, India",English

To further examine this domain, we developed a conceptual framework based on the existing literature of consumer research and financial well-being and assessed how financial literacy, socialization and attitude towards money influence the financial well-being of young adults. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted on 446 young adults (preliminary study n = 156; main study n = 290; mean age 22 years) in India. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that financial discussion with parents during childhood positively influences financial well-being of young adults. In addition, we found that relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being is not significant. Furthermore, the study reveals the role of attitude towards money as a strong predictor of financial well-being.

A Qualitative Investigation Into the Psychosocial Experiences of a Sample of Indian People,2020,Frontiers in Psychology,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to the entire world and is severely affecting social psychology. We conducted semi-structured interviews on 59 subjects from India to investigate the impact of information, misinfodemics (spread of wrong information), and isolation on their psychology. We perform qualitative analysis on the data. Our findings reveal that flow of information leads to anxiety, caution, and knowledge; while misinfodemics cause panic, distrust, and confusion; and isolation creates cognitive dissonance (the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes) and adaptability among masses. The encouraging part of our findings is that, as of now, the situation is far from the state of depression. Practically, our research calls upon the government to support the masses in fighting through the crisis by focusing on pointed psychological counseling. We contribute theoretically to the body of knowledge in the field of social psychology, which is studying the psychological interventions to avoid panic amid pandemic.

One such impact is the altered circadian rhythm, which is very important for proper functioning of the body and a good sleep. This altered circadian rhythm can have an impact on waking and sleep life of the nightshift workers. This qualitative study is to find the dream pattern among the nightshift workers and to find the frequency in dreaming among this group. Dreams are the reflections of the waking life and dream patterns are seen among groups sharing similar wake life experiences. This study is conducted with nine nightshift and nine dayshift workers, dream journal was used to collect the dreams from the participants. The frequency of dreaming is seen more among the nightshift workers. The dream patterns among both the groups are similar but there are dreams that make the nightshift group different from the dayshift. The dreams of the nightshift group includes mainly their friends and the feelings of being stuck/in danger. Also, their dreams were more fantastic in nature and have more emotional content. The study shows that sexual dreams are seen majorly among the nightshift group. This finding can be further used to conduct researches on the impact of nightshift on the sexual health and overall well being of nightshift workers and the reflection of the same in their dreams. © 2020.

"Agarwal S., Bhal K.T.",A Multidimensional Measure of Responsible Leadership: Integrating Strategy and Ethics,2020,Group and Organization Management,"Research on leadership generally discusses the normative and strategic perspectives of leadership separately. However, in the context of stakeholder theory and corporate sustainability, researchers and practitioners have called for the integration of these two seemingly disparate perspectives to create a hybrid leadership framework. In this regard, theoretical work on responsible leadership (RL) combines the disciplines of ethics and strategy to propose integrative behaviors. Nonetheless, RL mostly has been explored as a one-dimensional concept with stakeholder welfare as the focus. Although this aspect is salient, leaders must display other ethical and strategic behaviors to respond to the changing demands of business. Therefore, we combine such behaviors into one RL framework. Through a strategic lens, we define the first two dimensions of RL as sustainable growth focus and multistakeholder consideration. Furthermore, these goal-setting behaviors are looked upon as genuine when they depend on leaders’ ethical behaviors. Therefore, we consider ethical leadership to be an inherent part of RL through the dimensions of the moral person and moral manager. Across four quantitative studies, we test the construct validity of the suggested four-factor structure of RL as well as its ability to predict relevant organizational outcomes such as individual followers’ moral courage and citizenship behaviors toward stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2020.",construct validation; integrative leadership framework; responsible leadership; scale development,"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India",English

It is not possible to realize sustainable development in the absence of nutritional well-being. One of the factors affecting nutritional status in developing countries is open defecation. India accounts for 90 percent of open defecation cases in South-Asia annually. Open defecation enables the absorption of fecal pathogens that leads to intestinal worms, diarrhoea, and environmental enteric malfunction. This leads to loss of appetite, lessening the body's immunity, disturbing the absorption of nutrients, and eventually leading to malnutrition. As there is not much scholarship on the relation between open defecation and malnutrition in the context of India, this study examines the linkages between open defecation and malnutrition among the under-five children in India. The examination is performed using data from the National Family Health Survey 2015–16, and assessing the nutritional status of children through stunting and underweight. The analysis clearly shows higher chances of being stunted and underweight with an increase in the prevalence of open defecation. Multivariate findings reveal that the chances of stunting and underweight are 13% and 28%, respectively, more among the population defecating in the open compared to those defecating in an improved toilet facility. Awareness and state's financial help in improving sanitation facilities are keys to reducing the level of open defecation in India.

Enactment of law is still far from eliminating the practices of girl child marriage and it remains a widespread practice in the Empowered Action Group (EAG) states in India. Objective: The study examines the effect of selected time varying and time constant coefficients on the prevalence of girl child marriage in the EAG states. In this regard the study has incorporated 4th round (2015–2016) of National Family Health Survey data. Methods: Cox regression hazard model were employed to assess how likelihood of hazard (girl's child marriage) vary in different socio-economic domains. Girls's are susceptible to get marriage prior to completion of 18 years age, considered as a hazard or failure otherwise survived from the hazard. Results: Findings consolidated and revealed the ground truth that there has a significant association between girl child marriage and respondent's wealth status, level of education, place of residence, as well as their religious belief and caste/tribe affiliation. Girls with no education or primary level of education, living in rural areas belong to poorest or poorer wealth quintile are more likely to be married at an early age. The likelihood of marriage of girl child is also higher among those girls whose religious belief is Hindu and affiliated to general category. Conclusion: Findings suggest that by facilitating the educational opportunity for girls, economic support to families belongs to poorest categories, increasing awareness in rural area about the adverse effect of early childhood marriage are the key and effective steps to mitigate the issue with a coordinated way. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Child marriage; Coefficients; EAG states; Hazard ratio; NFHS,"Department of Geography, Raiganj University, Uttar Dinajpur, West Bengal, India; Department of Geography, Raiganj University, Raiganj, Uttar Dinajpur, West Bengal, India",English

With this in mind, electronic search of databases including MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect and Google scholar were carried out from inception till March 2020 to identify relevant English language peer reviewed articles related to cyberchondria. Generated abstracts were grouped according to their thematic focus and summarized. A total of 49 articles were reviewed. Articles directly evaluating cyberchondria were very few and most of the treatment evidence was extrapolated from trials on health anxiety. Cyberchondria appears to be a phenomenologically overlapping entity with, yet distinguishable from, health anxiety and there may be merit in studying the two constructs separately. Four validated self-assessment measures for cyberchondria are available in literature. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered either physically or through the internet (iCBT) have been found to be effective for both health anxiety and cyberchondria. Pharmacologic strategies for health anxiety have mainly involved the use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, with mean effective dosages higher than for depression/anxiety. Prevention of cyberchondria needs to focus on appropriate harm reduction strategies as well as supply and demand side measures.

The utility of bio-inspired learning methods lie in its ability to discover unknown patterns, and its less dependence on mathematical modeling or exhaustive training. In this paper, we propose a new bio-inspired learning model for a single-class classifier to detect abnormality in video object trajectories. The method uses a simple but dynamic extreme learning machine (ELM) and hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) together referred to as ELM-HTM in an unsupervised way to learn and classify time series patterns. The method has been tested on trajectory sequences in traffic surveillance to find abnormal behaviors such as high-speed, unusual stops, driving in wrong directions, loitering, etc. Experiments have also been performed with 3D air signatures captured using sensors and used for biometric authentication(forged/genuine). The results indicate a significant gain over training time and classification accuracy. The proposed method outperforms in predicting long-time patterns by observing small steps with an average accuracy gain of 15% as compared to the state-of-the-art HTM. The method has applications in detecting abnormal activities in videos by learning the movement patterns as well as in biometric authentication. © 2020 The Author(s)",Anomaly detection; Bio-inspired learning; ELM; HTM; Trajectory analysis,"Department of Physics and Technology, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, 9019, Norway; School of Electrical Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, Bhubaneswar, 751013, India; Department of Mathematics, National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, 713209, India; Department of Computer Science, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, 247667, India; Department of Computer Science, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, 9019, Norway",English

Underpinned by the stakeholder theory, this study was designed to explore the perspective of parents and nutrition educators regarding urban Indian adolescents’ food habits. Thirty-two educators and 280 parents from five independent, English-speaking, secondary schools in Kolkata, India completed a paper-based instrument consisting of both closed and open-ended measures. Qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis informed by the Template Analysis Technique. Descriptive and cross-tabulation analyses were employed to assess quantitative data. Three quarters (75%) of the respondents were dissatisfied with the ubiquitous consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and sugar-sweetened beverages as well as the low intakes of healthy foods like fruits and vegetables among urban Indian adolescents. Six reasons were advanced for such unhealthy consumption including i) Proliferation of fast food retail outlets; ii) Hyper-palatability of fast food; iii) Marketing of fast food on electronic and social media; iv) Diminished household cooking practices; v) Lack of food knowledge; vi) Tendency to seek peer group acceptance. Both parents and educators suggested some healthy eating strategies aimed at improving the food and nutrition situation in Indian secondary schools to foster healthy eating among pupils. These included: i) Restrictions on the sale of unhealthy foods in school canteens; ii) Increased availability of attractive and palatable nutritious foods; iii) Discussion of the advantages of consuming healthy foods and inclusion of food preparation techniques in the school curriculum; iv) Home Economics coursework to be made mandatory for students. The findings suggest that Indian parents and teachers are likely to support changes to the food and nutrition curricula and to school food provision to foster healthy eating among adolescents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Adolescent; Dietary behaviour; India; Parent; School; Teacher,"Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, VIC, 3125, Australia; Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai, Mumbai, Maharashtra  400076, India",English

Social support is strongly associated with mental wellbeing, yet most studies have examined the impact of support from partners and family members rather than peers, community members, or health care providers. This study explores the supportive role of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) contacts for antenatal anxiety. Methods: Data were analyzed from the Saving Children, Improving Lives project, a quasi-experimental study conducted among rural, pregnant women in India. Regression models were used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals for the relationship frequency of ASHA contacts and antenatal anxiety. Antenatal anxiety was measured using a subscale of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results: The sample consisted of 480 pregnant women. Reported antenatal anxiety prevalence was 27% (95% CI 23%, 31%). Participants who were more frequently visited by ASHAs at home (aPR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.76, 0.98) and more frequently accompanied by ASHAs to their antenatal care visits (aPR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.78, 0.95) were less likely to report antenatal anxiety. ASHA home visits were protective for the most vulnerable women (primigravida and those experiencing domestic violence) and ASHA accompaniment to antenatal care visits was equally protective for all women. Conclusions: ASHAs are valued for their contribution towards maternal health education and linking women of reproductive age to healthcare services. Our findings additionally suggest the important role ASHAs play in providing social support to pregnant women, particularly those who are most vulnerable to experiencing antenatal anxiety. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Antenatal anxiety; Community health workers; Social support,"Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States; Public Health Research Institute of India, Mysore, Karnataka, India; Department of Health Promotion Sciences, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States; Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences, Loni, Maharashtra, India; Florida International University, Miami, FL, United States; Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Family and Community Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States",English

"Katou A., Budhwar P., Chand M.D.",The moderating effects of transformational leadership and self-worth in the idiosyncratic deals – employee reactions relationship: A study of Indian hospitality industry,2020,Personnel Review,"Purpose: This paper examines the relationship between timing of negotiations and idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) through the moderating effects of core self-evaluations (CSE), and between i-deals and employee reactions through the moderating effects of transformational leadership behaviour (TLB) in the Indian hospitality industry. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 275 employees working in 39 companies responded to a self-administered questionnaire. To test the research hypotheses, the methodology of structural equation models was used. Findings: The results show that the relationship between before hiring negotiations and i-deals is stronger for those individuals who had low self-worth, due to countervailing forces created by their belief that they may not be eligible for i-deals. In contrast, the relationship between after hiring negotiations and i-deals is stronger for those who had high self-worth, due to their belief that they were entitled to i-deals. Additionally, the research highlights that the relationship between i-deals and employee reactions is stronger for those organisations, which are high on TLB. Research limitations/implications: The data does not allow for investigating dynamic causal inferences, because they were collected using a questionnaire at a single point in time, and they were reported in retrospect, raising measurement concerns about recall bias. Practical implications: From a managerial point of view, the findings of this study inform that in negotiating both employment conditions and work arrangements, organisations should try to achieve i-deals that are primarily flexibility focused, and that in increasing efficiency organisations should make the employees feel well supported in order to develop more confidence in deploying skills and abilities to address a more open view of their i-deals. Originality/value: The study contributes to our understanding about the Indian hospitality industry by utilising the self-enhancement theory in examining whether individual differences moderate the relationship between the timing of negotiations and i-deals, and also by utilizing the social exchange theory to examine whether TLB moderates the relationship between i-deals and employee reactions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Employee reactions; Idiosyncratic deals; India; Self-evaluation; Timing of negotiations; Transformational leadership,"Department of Business Administration, University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece; Aston Business School, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom; Department of Tourism and Hotel Management, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, India",English

Schools and social avenues have been placed on prolonged lockdowns, with people continuing to maintain physical distance. Adolescents and young people have had to endure significant stress alongside dealing with developmental characteristics. Amidst all of this, studies report an increase in gaming addiction and internet use with detrimental impact on psychosocial well-being. The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of lockdown on internet use in adolescents, comparing their habits from before the pandemic. Furthermore, this research aimed to investigate the relationship between gaming addiction, internet use and COVID-19 worries. Adolescents from several countries (e.g., India, Malaysia, Mexico and the UK) completed online questionnaires, shared via social media and youth networks. These measures included questions on internet, social media, gaming, depression, loneliness, escapism and COVID-19. Results show that adolescents generally have increased their use of social media sites and streaming services. Further, those who scored highly on gaming addiction, compulsive internet use and social media use also reported high scores of depression, loneliness, escapism, poor sleep quality and anxiety related to the pandemic. Our findings indicate that, regardless of country of residence, the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant effect on adolescent internet use and psychosocial well-being. The need to address pandemic related distress to reduce the effect of maladaptive coping strategies is highlighted.

ZnO is a biocompatible and bio-safe material that possesses photo-oxidizing and photo-catalysis impacts on chemical and biological species. ZnO nanomaterials could interact chemically as well as physically in order to exhibit antibacterial activities. Chemical interactions of the ZnO nanomaterials with bacterial cells leads to the photo-induced production of reactive oxygenated species (ROS), formation of H2 O2, and the release of Zn2+ ions. In contrast, physical interaction could show biocidal effects through cell envelope rupturing, cellular internalization, or mechanical damage. In this article, we present a green method using Tridax Procumbens leaf extract to synthesize Ag-doped ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) in order to explore the synergistic antibacterial properties of Ag and ZnO nanoparticles against certain gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The newly synthesized Ag-doped ZnO NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in order to study the crystalline structure, composition, and purity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) techniques were used to study particle size, shape, and morphology. The XRD and UV studies confirmed the ZnO phase. The absorbance peak around 618 cm-1-749 cm-1 in the FTIR spectrum referred to the presence of silver. The surface morphological studies also supported the FTIR result. The synthesized sample exhibited enhanced antibacterial activity irrespective of all tested microorganisms than the standard antibiotic used. The maximum size distribution of particles is found to be around 60 nm from the DLS technique. © 2020, Iranian Environmental Mutagen Society.

Trusted eldercare service is an important issue for a matured nation. The paper addresses the preconditions of healthy ageing and sustainable value integrated eldercare in a developing and a developed society. In India, professional eldercare is about a decade old and is still emerging to get a foothold in the health care system. The aim is to explore understanding and values of home-based eldercare (HBEC) in India from a multiple stakeholder’s perspective and to understand the value related challenges and issues in developments with HBEC in Sweden which has a century old experience of professional and public organised eldercare. The study included 210 in-depth interviews, 105 each from India and Sweden. The in-depth interviews of various stakeholders including older individuals, their relatives, caregivers, managers and doctors. Interviews and focused group discussions were carried out across six cities in India and 10 municipalities in Sweden. The qualitative data were analysed to conceptualise the stakeholders understanding of HBEC, the values associated with care giving, perceived challenges and issues in the emerging HBEC sector in India. The findings highlight the changing values in the societies with relation to the needs and context of eldercare in both countries. These preconditions for compassion and work engagement in care giving as well as competence development in caregivers need to be strengthened in the contexts of care and in alignment with sociocultural values. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",eldercare; Home-care; older persons; organisation; stakeholders; values,"Department of Psychology, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of BarodaGujarat, India; Department of Sociology and Work Science, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden; Anil Surendra Modi School of Commerce (ASMSOC), NMIMS MumbaiMaharashtra, India; Faculty of Caring Science, Work Life and Social Welfare, University of Borås, Borås, Sweden",English

Ten young adults wrote their life experiences of guilt, shame and remorse, respectively, yielding a total of 34 scenarios. The scenarios were presented to 138 participants, and they were instructed to reflect upon the emotion (GSR) that best suited the scenarios. Principal component analysis indicated that the same scenario induced guilt as well as shame or remorse depending on the valence. Scenarios with positive factor load assessed guilt, whereas shame and remorse had negative factor load. Following an iterative process, the scenarios were converted into illustrations where each scenario was depicted in a storyboard comprising a set of three illustrations. Generalized procrustes analysis was performed to assess item equivalence between the narrations and the corresponding storyboards. Fourteen participants first rated the narratives and then the storyboards after a gap of 24 h. The findings suggest no significant difference between the illustrated scenarios and the narrative, thus leading to 13 scenarios.

In exploring the relationship between older people and their environment, the concept of place insideness is seen as central to constructing feelings of identity, belonging and attachment in old age. Yet there has been little research exploring how older adults experience place insideness across different urban, social and cultural contexts which is an impediment to identifying effective interventions for age-friendly cities and communities. This article explores how place insideness is experienced amongst older adults across India, Brazil and the United Kingdom. The article presents qualitative findings from 294 semi-structured interviews collected across 9 cities and 27 neighbourhoods. The findings reveal that older adults cultivate their sense of place insideness in old age through dimensions of physical insideness (i.e., environmental competence in navigating and engaging in the community), social insideness (i.e., knowing others) and autobiographical insideness (i.e., shared place histories). In drawing on older people’s understanding of their communities, this article explores the opportunities and challenges in developing a sense of place insideness to support ageing well. We identify implications for policy and practice in terms of how we can better design urban environments as age-friendly communities which support a greater sense of place for older people. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",age-friendly communities; neighbourhood; older people; place insideness; Sense of place,"The Urban Institute, Heriot Watt University, Riccarton Campus, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India; Universidade Federal de Pelotas, School of Architecture and Urbanism, Pelotas, Brazil; School of Nursing and Health Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom; Department of Social Care and Social Work, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom; Department of Psychology, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom; Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India; Delhi, India; Calcutta Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India; National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi, Delhi, India; School of Psychology, University of Keele, United Kingdom; Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom",English

Therefore, it is important to understand the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) in mother-child pairs in India. This study attempted to explore the coexistence of DBM among mother-child pairs in India. Also, this study tries to explore various factors associated with DBM in India. The study utilized data from national representative cross-sectional fourth round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted in 2015–16. The study used anthropometric indices such as height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age to examine the nutritional status of children aged 0–59 months. Further, the study used body mass index (BMI) of women and classified according to WHO cut-off values (normal BMI: 18.5 to &lt;24.99 kg/m2 and overweight/obesity: ≥25.0 kg/m2). The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were applied to assess the factors associated with DBM. It was found that 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent, and 2.1 percent of mother-child pairs in the same household were a combination of Overweight/Obese women with stunted children (OM/SC), Overweight/Obese women with underweight children (OM/UC), and Overweight/Obese women with wasted children respectively (OM/WC). Additionally, 6% of mother-child pairs in the same household were suffering from DBM. Mothers with secondary education were more likely to face risk of DBM as compared to uneducated mothers [OR: 1.17, p &lt; 0.01]. DBM was higher among mother-child pairs, which belong to rich wealth quintile than mother-child pairs from poor wealth quintile [OR: 1.98, p &lt; 0.01]. Interventions need to be scaled up to target undernutrition as well as obesity at the same time in a household. Isolated focus on undernourished children may not be sufficient, and it is recommended to address different nutritional problems simultaneously. Another important recommendation is to formulate nutrition interventions keeping in mind the inclusion of wealthier families, as DBM is higher among such families. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Double burden of malnutrition; India; Obesity; Stunting,"Department of Public Health and Mortality Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India; Department of Population Policies and Programmes, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India",English
"Panigrahi S.K., Mishra A.K.",Total Emission Time Resolved Decay: a Method for Measurement and Resolution of Broad-Band Emission,2020,Journal of Fluorescence,"This article reports a time-resolved fluorescence data acquisition technique termed as “Total Emission Time Resolved Decay” (TETRD). TETRD is recorded by using zero-order diffraction of emission grating in TCSPC instrument. TETRD decay curve has entire wavelength dependent decay information buried in it. Cut-off filters are used to avoid scattering contamination. Two existing approaches are used for analysing the interconnected TETRD data. (i) First, global analysis: for discretely decaying multiple components, TETRD dataset is analyzed using global analysis. The normalized pre-exponentials (αi) and relative amplitudes (fi) recovered from global analysis reflect the individual component emission more faithfully and resembles with steady-state spectral data as well. (ii) Second, stretched exponential fitting (StrEF): for continuous lifetime distribution systems, StrEF (I(t) = I0 exp[−(t/τ)1/h]) has been used to analyse TETRD data. The average lifetime (τ) of StrEF matches well with the average lifetime of multi-exponential fitting, the heterogeneity factor (h) of StrEF is an additional parameter, which informs about local heterogeneity in the system. It is shown that the lifetimes obtained with TETRD matches well with the lifetimes obtained using conventional time resolved emission spectra (TRES). TETRD holds advantage in rapid data acquisition and facilitates inclusion of another variable (like concentration, solvent composition, pH, excitation wavelength etc.) into experimental design. Further, with the use of an appropriate data analysis tool, the multi-component decay profiles can be resolved conveniently. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Humic fluorescence decay; Multi-component fluorescence decay; Multi-fluorophoric systems; Total emission decay,"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Chennai, 600036, India",English

However, there is a dearth of literature exploring the perceived frequency and acceptability of mother-in-law abuse or options available for survivors of this type of abuse. The goal of this qualitative study was to add to the in-law abuse literature by exploring men’s and women’s perspectives about physical and psychological abuse perpetrated by mothers-in-law against daughters-in-law in northern India. Forty-four women and 34 men residing in rural and urban areas of the Udaipur district in the northwest state of Rajasthan participated in semistructured interviews. Women, but not men, thought mother-in-law abuse was common in their communities. Psychological abuse was accepted in certain situations; however, few male or female participants agreed with physical mother-in-law abuse. Men were described as mediators in the context of mother-in-law abuse, and male participants thought that disrespecting a mother-in-law was a justifiable reason for a man to hit his wife. Both male and female participants described few options available for a woman experiencing mother-in-law abuse, apart from asking her husband to intervene or living as a separate, nuclear family. Grassroots initiatives and legislative policy should focus on addressing the immediate needs of women experiencing mother-in-law abuse and developing intergenerational interventions to educate men and women about the dynamics of law abuse. © The Author(s) 2017.",domestic violence; in-law abuse; patriarchy; perceptions; qualitative; South Asia,"Boston Medical CenterMA, United States; Action Research and Training for Health, Udaipur, India; Duke University, Durham, NC, United States",English

Our research question was: what lessons can be learned from the lived experience of these farmers to address current challenges of cassava farming The results of our study revealed diversity in advisory messages from farmer to farmer and agricultural extension agents. Farmers' messages focused on encouraging farmers' commitment and motivation towards farming business, availability of needed financial resources for the entire production season, willingness to reinvest profits, and access to farmland for future expansion. In contrast, the traditional messages from agricultural extension agents focused on encouraging group formation to address marketing challenges, diversification of farm operations, and good agricultural practices.

In this study, the published Partition narratives of displaced Punjabi and Sindhi survivors were content analyzed, and themes were extracted. The working self of the Partition survivors triggered recall of this event, whose evaluation varied along three dimensions, namely, avoidance, rumination, and reflection. The theme of repression was central to avoidance narratives. Furthermore, rumination narratives were marked by nostalgia and a sense of alienation. Finally, the themes of cognitive reappraisal, self-complexity, and self-discrepancy resolution surfaced in reflection narratives.

Problem solving is a well-tested mental health intervention in many populations. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a brief, transdiagnostic problem-solving intervention for common adolescent mental health problems when delivered by non-specialist school counsellors in New Delhi, India. Methods: This randomised trial was done in six government-run schools (three all-boys schools, two all-girls schools, and one co-educational school) that serve low-income communities. We recruited participants from grades 9 to 12 (ages 12–20 years) by selecting students with persistently elevated mental health symptoms accompanied by distress or functional impairment. Clinical eligibility criteria were assessed by research assistants using the Hindi-language version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), with reference to locally validated borderline cutoff scores of 19 or greater for boys and 20 or greater for girls on the SDQ Total Difficulties scale, an abnormal score of 2 or more on the SDQ Impact scale, and persistence of more than 1 month on the SDQ Chronicity index. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to problem solving delivered through a brief (2–3 week) counsellor-led intervention with supporting printed materials (intervention group), or problem solving delivered via printed booklets alone (control group). Primary outcomes were adolescent-reported mental health symptoms (SDQ Total Difficulties scale) and idiographic psychosocial problems (Youth Top Problems [YTP]) at 6 weeks. Primary analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis at the 6-week endpoint. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03630471. Findings: Participants were enrolled between Aug 20, and Dec 4, 2018. 283 eligible adolescents were referred to the trial, and 251 (89%) of these were enrolled (mean age 15·61 years; 174 [69%] boys). 125 participants were allocated to each group (after accounting for one participant in the intervention group who withdrew consent after randomisation). Primary outcome data were available for 245 (98%) participants. At 6 weeks, the mean YTP scores were 3·52 (SD 2·66) in the intervention group and 4·60 (2·75) in the control group (adjusted mean difference –1·01, 95% CI –1·63 to –0·38; adjusted effect size 0·36, 95% CI 0·11 to 0·61; p=0·0015). The mean SDQ Total Difficulties scores were 17·48 (5·45) in the intervention group and 18·33 (5·45) in the control group (–0·86, –2·14 to 0·41; 0·16, –0·09 to 0·41; p=0·18). We observed no adverse events. Interpretation: A brief lay counsellor-delivered problem-solving intervention combined with printed booklets seemed to have a modest effect on psychosocial outcomes among adolescents with diverse mental health problems compared with problem-solving booklets alone. This counsellor-delivered intervention might be a suitable first-line intervention in a stepped care approach, which is being evaluated in ongoing studies.

We identify three types of cherished possessions that are embodied with different roles and emotional qualities: first, religious artifacts that signify a sense of security in day-to-day life; second, possessions embedded with memories of past life events that elicit pride and a sense of continuity; and, third, possessions linked to memories of family members and pets, which reflect efforts to create a sense of co-presence. This paper contributes to a new dialogue on how empirical research on home-making practices can enrich and sustain the emotional well-being of older adults living in care homes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Population Research Centre, Faculty of Spatial Sciences, University of Groningen, PO Box 800, Groningen, 9700 AV, Netherlands; Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru, India; Transdisciplinary Centre for Qualitative Methods, Prasanna School of Public Health, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India; Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Utrecht University, Utrecht, 3512 JE, Netherlands",English
"Aandi Subramaniyam B., Muliyala K.P., Suchandra H.H., Reddi V.S.K.",Diagnosing catatonia and its dimensions: Cluster analysis and factor solution using the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS),2020,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Advances in research into catatonia in the preceding two decades has offered increasing clarity and an improved understanding of various aspects of this complex syndrome. Despite the above, there are several aspects that hinder a broader interpretation of these findings, the most common being a lack of consensus on the criteria required for diagnosing catatonia. Whilst being the most frequently used tool for diagnosis, the number of signs from Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) needed to diagnose catatonia remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the number of signs required to accurately diagnose catatonia using BFCRS and delineate its dimensions in an acute inpatient unit in the Indian setting. A random sample of 300 patients were evaluated for catatonia within 24 h of admission. Cluster Analysis followed by discriminant analysis and receiver operating curve analysis (ROC) provided cut-off values for diagnosing catatonia syndrome. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used to identify factors in those with catatonia. Findings revealed that a cut off of two signs from both Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument or BFCSI (sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 96.2 % as well as a positive predictive value [PPV] of 79.6 % and negative predictive value [NPV] 100 % with ROC AUC value of 0.98) and complete BFCRS (sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 90.7 %, PPV of 80.7 and NPV of 100 % with ROC AUC for at least two items cut-off being 0.95) accurately detected catatonia. However, the prevalence of catatonia in the same population increased by 4% from 16.3% to 20.3% using the BFCRS rather than the BFCSI. The BFCRS generated a 3-factor model accounting for 65.48 % variance offering the best fit, indicating three discrete dimensions to catatonia, namely retarded, excited and what we named as “aberrant volitional”. Interestingly, the aberrant volitional dimension comprises of signs that need to be elicited rather than passively observed and excluding one, none of them are part of the BFCSI. Findings of this study suggest that the BFCRS more accurately detects catatonia rather than the BFCSI. Additionally, three dimensions of catatonia more coherently explain the catatonic syndrome given that 55.7 % of the sample had signs from more than one factor concurrently. We propose that the BFCRS rather than BFCSI be routinely administered for evaluating all suspected cases of catatonia to ensure more accurate detection as well as identifying the aberrant volitional dimensional signs more consistently. The three-dimensional model also offers great opportunities to further unravel the pathophysiological basis of catatonic signs more systematically. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",BFCRS; Catatonia; Diagnostic cut-off; Dimensional model; Signs and symptoms,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, 560029, India",English
Bandyopadhyay S.,Gendered Well-Being: Cross-Sectional Evidence from Poor Urban Households in India,2020,Social Indicators Research,"This paper is an analysis of the subjective well-being of women relative to men in low-income urban households in India. Education and employment are pathways to greater financial well-being which is presumably of great salience to poor populations. However, either or both of these may increase aspirations. The social norms that restrict the autonomy of women may mute the impact of education and employment in a way that does not happen to men. To address this hypothesis, the paper uses primary data from a survey of over 1000 respondents across slums in Delhi. The paper finds that education and employment does reduce the well-being of women relative to men. We show that these gender varying correlations are robust to omitted variables bias. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Gender; Poverty; Social norms; Urban; Well-being,"Indian Institute of Management, Indore, J-Block (Room No. 217), First Floor, Prabandh Shikhar, Rau-Pithampur Road, Indore, Madhya Pradesh  453556, India",English

However, very few evidence-based, manualized, and replicable programs have been documented in such settings. Methods: Project ImPACT (Ingersoll & Dvortcsak, 2010)- a parent-mediated Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention (NDBI) for young children with ASD shown to improve social communication, engagement and play was adapted and subsequently implemented at a child development center in an urban setting in India to meet the needs of the community. A quasi-experimental pre-post study design was utilized, with questionnaires about family satisfaction, parent-perceived social-communication skills of children, and parental stress used to gather information. Video-recordings of parent-child interaction were coded to assess parent fidelity. Caregivers of 57 children enrolled in the Intervention, with complete data for feasibility and acceptability of the intervention as well as parent-perceived outcomes available for 39 (n = 39). Results: Results showed that urban Indian parents found the intervention feasible and acceptable, were able to demonstrate the strategies taught and perceived improvement in their children's social communication skills. In addition, parent stress levels decreased after completion of the intervention. Conclusion: Findings suggest that brief parent-mediated intervention interventions like Project ImPACT can be successfully implemented in low-resource, culturally diverse settings, thereby opening avenues for replication and expansion of much-needed services in this region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Autism; Cultural adaptation; Feasibility; LMIC; Parent-mediated intervention; Project ImPACT,"Ummeed Child Development Center, 1-B, 1/62, Mantri Pride Building, N.M.

"Kumar P.N.S., Sharma A., Andrade C.","A pilot, open-label investigation of the efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of major depression",2020,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Introduction: Glucosamine hydrochloride normalizes GABA antagonist- and social defeat-induced behavioral alterations and upregulation of immune response genes in Drosophila and mice, respectively, increases hippocampal neurogenesis in mice, and demonstrates efficacy in murine behavioral models of depression. This suggests that it may have antidepressant potential in humans. Methods: In an open label, 4-week pilot study, patients (n = 20) diagnosed with mild to moderate, nonpsychotic (unipolar) major depressive episode (DSM-IV) were treated with glucosamine in monotherapy at 1 g/day for 1 week and 2 g/day for 3 more weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 2- and 4-week follow up using the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and other measures. An intent-to-treat analysis with last-observation-carried-forward was conducted on the whole sample. Results: Three patients dropped out before the first follow up; the rest completed the study. HAM-D scores dropped by a third in the sample as a whole; however, only 4 patients (20 %) were considered HAM-D responders (improvement by >50 %) and only 2 patients (10 %) were CGI-I responders (endpoint score of 1 or 2). There were only 2 (10 %) HAM-D remitters (endpoint score <8). There were no serious adverse events and the treatment was well tolerated. Conclusions: Encouraging preclinical results notwithstanding, glucosamine monotherapy does not appear to be effective against major depression. A more authoritative conclusion would require a randomized controlled trial. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Antidepressant; Clinical trial; Depression; Glucosamine; Neuroplasticity,"IQRAA International Hospital and Research Centre, Kozhikode, Kerala  673 020, India; CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, 110025, India; Department of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neurotoxicology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, 560 029, India",English

We recruited 150 eligible outpatients (58 men and 92 women) with OCD, who attended a specialty OCD Clinic over a period of one year. Occurrence of any life event including reproductive life events in the year before the onset of OCD was assessed using the Interview of Recent Life Events (IRLE). Reproductive life events in the year prior to onset of OCD were overrepresented in women compared to men. Postpartum onset and worsening of OCD was reported in 14 % and 11 % of women respectively. Menarche and menopause as life events were infrequently reported (3% and 1%). Symmetry obsessions and ordering compulsions were more common in women with post-partum onset of OCD than those without. Post-partum period seems to be associated with onset and exacerbation of OCD; therefore, routine screening for OCD during this period is necessary. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Life events; Obsessive compulsive disorder; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Women,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560029, India",English
Rajkumar R.P.,COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature,2020,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Public health; Stress,"Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry, 605 006, India",English

Should it be always verified based on the objective and analytical methods that we adapt according to our progressive advancements in science or is there any other way of conceiving knowledge? This is the context where modern sophistication should embrace an ancient perspective. Recently, there have been great advancements in the science of consciousness and meditation. Meditation received much attention as a practice for wellbeing and as a tool for cognitive enhancement. Even though, hundreds of objective studies have been conducted on different practices of meditation across different traditions, there is one essential element missing in almost all of these studies: the discussion of the subjective experience of meditation. Embracing the traditional insights on meditation, we study this element by defining meditation based on the concept of introspection. In addition, we hypothesize that introspective meta-awareness associated with the non-conceptual experience of meditation may result in the conceptual understanding of natural phenomena via pathways of intuition. The proposed advancement bears implications for the ontological and epistemological basis of experiential knowledge, as well as, for developing introspection and meditation-based interventions for self and consciousness disorders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Consciousness; Feeling; First-person; Introspection; Intuition; Meditation; Meta-awareness; Triple-aspect Monism,"Research Scholar, Bengaluru, India; Instituto de Biociências de Botucatu, São Paulo State University, Brazil; National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Indian Institute of Science Campus, India",English

Methods: We conducted a medical literature search to identify DBS research performed by investigators with a primary affiliation in Asian and Oceania countries between March 1, 2013, and March 1, 2019, followed by an international survey-based study. Additionally, we obtained added information regarding the DBS challenges and opportunities from the technology/industry perspective within China and Japan. We also described the current situation of DBS in India. Results: Most publications (390/494; 78.95%) in the English language originated from East Asia. In West Asia, Turkey, Israel, and Iran accounted for most DBS publications. We found no publications from the remaining 35 Asian countries. Lack of community referrals to tertiary centers was identified as the most common limitation for the widespread use of DBS in Asia (68.97%). In China, despite an increasing number of centers performing DBS surgeries, most of them accomplished less than 10 cases per year. In contrast, the number of DBS cases in Japan has been decreasing. Centers offering DBS surgeries as well as corresponding fellowship training in India are limited. Conclusion: Appropriate referrals, access, infrastructure, and the presence of full multidisciplinary DBS teams are common limitations of DBS in Asia. Most centers in China, Japan, and India performed less than 10 cases per year and a future study is expected to address the impact on quality in centers performing such few cases. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Ramirez-Zamora, Meng, Lin, Lai, Li, Chang, Morishita, Inoue, Fujioka, Oyama, Coyne, Voon, Doshi, Wu, Liu, Patel, Almeida, Wagle Shukla, Hu, Foote, Zhang, Sun and Okun.",Asia; China; deep brain stimulation; India; Japan; Oceania,"Department of Functional Neurosurgery, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Norman Fixel Institute of Neurological Diseases, Program for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration, Department of Neurology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, United States; Department of Neurosurgery, Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; Department of Neurosurgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Neurosurgery, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Neurology, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Neurology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Department of Psychiatry, Addenbrooke’s Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Neurosurgery, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, India; Department of Neurology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China",English

Some research has been done in the area of Personalised Medicine and several new drugs have been already discovered. However, adequate research is yet to be performed to sort out various hurdles that are hindering implementation of this novel medicare system on a larger scale. One of the hurdles is the so-called trust factor. In the present paper, it has been our endeavour to investigate whether the trust issues have a moderating effect on the success of adoption of personalised medicine. A survey-based post facto methodology has been adopted for this purpose. Responses have been collected from a number of people, who are medical practitioners/medical researchers/pharmacists/regulatory board members/patients. The dataset obtained thereby has been analysed by using advanced statistical techniques and modern statistical software packages.

"Chanpa N.B., Kotecha I., Kumar P., Tiwari D.S., Vasavada D.A., Bhatt R.B.",Stigma and discrimination among doctors toward health-care staff working at COVID-19 sites,2020,Archives of Mental Health,"Background: Different infectious disease outbreaks such as bubonic plague, Asiatic flu, cholera, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Ebola have been associated with polarization, racism, blame, and resultant psychological distress. Health-care providers involved in managing the COVID-19 crisis face challenges such as stigma and discrimination. Aim: The current study is aimed to explore stigma and discrimination related to COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out during April and May 2020. Doctors working at health-care facility were approached and requested to fill semi-structured pro forma containing the following parts: (1) Demographic details of participants, (2) Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire 5 (BIPQ-5), (3) Physical Distance and Discrimination Questionnaire, (4) Avoidance Questionnaire, (5) feeling thermometer toward a person having COVID, HIV, TB, Swine flu. Statistical Analysis: Data entry and analysis was performed using Microsoft excel and SPSS 26 version software. Independent t-test was used to compare the mean and standard deviation of the BIPQ score, physical distance, and discrimination questionnaire score with various demographic variables and avoidance questionnaire. Results: A total of 323 doctors participated in the study. Out of which 51.39% reports that it is necessary to avoid persons and 30.60% have a problem if a person eats in mess/canteen when working in COVID-19 care. Participants living with family members have statistically significant (P < 0.001) a higher score on the BIPQ, and Physical Distancing and Discrimination Questionnaire.

Aim: The study aimed to estimate the effect of household cooking fuels and smoking habits on the prevalence of ARI among under-five children over India. Methods: This study employs nationally representative data National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4: 2015–2016) which was gathered and arranged by International Institute for Population Science, Mumbai as the Nodal Agency under the patronage of the Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India. The χ2 test implemented to assess the difference by the prevalence of ARI against the use of household cooking fuels, smoking habits and socio-demographic characteristics. Then binary logistic regression models were incorporated to look at the crude and net impact of cooking fuels used in households on childhood ARI. Result &amp; Findings: ARI was mostly affective for those children who were from those households where biomasses were the main source of cooking fuels and significantly the prevalence of ARI was related to the combustion of biomass fuels for cooking (p &lt; 0.0005). The smoking habits (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.18–1.70) and use of biomass cooking fuels (OR = 1.03, CI: 0.86–1.08) significantly predicted the higher probability of ARI prevalence among children.

The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a well-established cognitive screening tool to diagnose dementia. But there have been few efforts to standardize the use of ACE-III across cohorts speaking different languages. The present study aimed to standardize and validate ACE-III across seven Indian languages and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test to detect dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the context of language heterogeneity. Methods: The original ACE-III was adapted to Indian languages: Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Urdu, Tamil, and Indian English by a multidisciplinary expert group. The ACE-III was standardized for use across all seven languages. In total, 757 controls, 242 dementia, and 204 MCI patients were recruited across five cities in India for the validation study. Psychometric properties of adapted versions were examined and their sensitivity and specificity were established. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of ACE-III in identifying dementia ranged from 0.90 to 1, sensitivity for MCI ranged from 0.86 to 1, and specificity from 0.83 to 0.93. Education but not language was found to have an independent effect on ACE-III scores. Optimum cut-off scores were established separately for low education (≤10 years of education) and high education (>10 years of education) groups.

"Valiyamattam G.J., Katti H., Chaganti V.K., O’Haire M.E., Sachdeva V.",Do Animals Engage Greater Social Attention in Autism? An Eye Tracking Analysis,2020,Frontiers in Psychology,"Background: Visual atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a well documented phenomenon, beginning as early as 2–6 months of age and manifesting in a significantly decreased attention to the eyes, direct gaze and socially salient information. Early emerging neurobiological deficits in perceiving social stimuli as rewarding or its active avoidance due to the anxiety it entails have been widely purported as potential reasons for this atypicality. Parallel research evidence also points to the significant benefits of animal presence for reducing social anxiety and enhancing social interaction in children with autism. While atypicality in social attention in ASD has been widely substantiated, whether this atypicality persists equally across species types or is confined to humans has not been a key focus of research insofar. Methods: We attempted a comprehensive examination of the differences in visual attention to static images of human and animal faces (40 images; 20 human faces and 20 animal faces) among children with ASD using an eye tracking paradigm. 44 children (ASD n = 21; TD n = 23) participated in the study (10,362 valid observations) across five regions of interest (left eye, right eye, eye region, face and screen). Results: Results obtained revealed significantly greater social attention across human and animal stimuli in typical controls when compared to children with ASD. However in children with ASD, a significantly greater attention allocation was seen to animal faces and eye region and lesser attention to the animal mouth when compared to human faces, indicative of a clear attentional preference to socially salient regions of animal stimuli. The positive attentional bias toward animals was also seen in terms of a significantly greater visual attention to direct gaze in animal images. Conclusion: Our results suggest the possibility that atypicalities in social attention in ASD may not be uniform across species. It adds to the current neural and biomarker evidence base of the potentially greater social reward processing and lesser social anxiety underlying animal stimuli as compared to human stimuli in children with ASD. © Copyright © 2020 Valiyamattam, Katti, Chaganti, O’Haire and Sachdeva.",animals; autism (ASD); eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); neurobiomarker; social attention; visual attention,"Department of Applied Psychology, Gitam University, Visakhapatnam, India; Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India; Department of Commerce, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India; Department of Comparative Pathobiology, Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Child Sight Institute, Nimmagadda Prasad Children’s Eye Care Centre, L V Prasad Eye Institute, GMRV Campus, Visakhapatnam, India",English
"Jaiswal A., Dyaram L.",Perceived diversity and employee well-being: mediating role of inclusion,2020,Personnel Review,"Purpose: While literature cites several distinct studies on workforce diversity and employee well-being (EWB), attention to their combined significance has been limited. Extant work highlights cognitive outcomes of diversity, while its impact on affect-related outcomes is underexplored. The purpose of this paper is to examine how employee perceptions of diversity (based on surface and/or knowledge attributes) influence their well-being and how perception of inclusion mediates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 248 full-time employees from large organizations across varied industries in India have participated in this survey-based study. Findings: Structural equation modeling results indicate surface and knowledge diversity to significantly impact EWB. Surface diversity adversely affected well-being, while knowledge diversity had favorable impact. Besides, inclusion was found to be a significant mediator between knowledge diversity and well-being but not between surface diversity and well-being. Research limitations/implications: Present study explores the diversity–well-being link through the lens of perceived inclusion. Future research should consider contextual factors that will influence these relationships. Practical implications: Managerial nudging can enhance employee self-control, intrinsic motivation and well-being. Further, managers should note how knowledge diversity aids in well-being toward constructive cross-functional synergy building. Originality/value: Study conceptualizes diversity from Indian social and employment perspectives, while incorporating inclusion as a contextual factor currently under-researched empirically in the Indian context. Further, the authors contribute to the limited literature on affect-related effects of diversity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Inclusion; Knowledge diversity; Perceived diversity; Surface diversity; Well-being,"Loyola Institute of Business AdministrationChennai, India; Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology MadrasChennai, India",English

Titanium (IV) isopropoxide act as the precursor and leaf extract act as the reducing agent. The synthesized TiO2 NPs are confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the crystalline size was calculated by the Scherrer’s formula(52nm) and as well as Williaman-Hall(W-H) equation(59 nm). The Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis shows the stability and particle size of approximately 88-94 nm of the synthesized TiO2 NPs. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirms the presence of various functional groups in the synthesized NPs. The UV absorption wavelength observed at the peak of 351 nm and the calculated energy band gap is found to be 3.27eV. The surface morphology of the synthesized TiO2 NPs is determined by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The rate of photodegradation of zoxamide in acetonitrile/water solvent system followed pseudofirst-order kinetics, and calculated half-lives were found to be in the range of 2.33-10.46 h. From this study, one photoproduct was isolated and characterized based on column chromatography, mass spectral data, and X-ray crystallography. The isolated photoproduct was identified as 3,5-dichloro-4 methyl benzoic acid. The plausible mechanistic pathway of the formation of photoproducts is also depicted. Langmuir– Hinshelwood (L–H) kinetic model was proposed for the rate equation of the zoxamide photodegradation in the presence of TiO2 NPs under UV irradiation. © 2020, Iranian Environmental Mutagen Society.

The study aimed to gain an understanding about the respondents’ unique experiences of caste-based stigmatization at their workplace, their overall experience of empowerment at work and the other spheres of their lives, and to capture their perceived importance of, and the success of reservation policy as well as several other initiatives taken by the Government of India for empowering the marginalized castes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 male Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe respondents working at respectable positions in the government organizations situated in the National Capital Region of Delhi. The phenomenological approach (Langdridge, 2007) was used to unearth the essence of the participant’s experiences of stigma driven treatments. The overall perceptions and experiences of the respondents included experiencing direct and indirect forms of caste-related discrimination at workplace; experiencing economic, social and psychological empowerment but not at the workplace; favouring the policy of reservation for Schedule Caste/Schedule Tribe in government jobs; and believing in the improper implementation of policies in India. The research findings indicate the incomplete success of the governmental policies for the holistic empowerment of the Indian marginalized castes. Copyright 2020: Divya Bhanot, Sunil K.

"Bhatnagar P., Shukla M., Pandey R.",Validating the Factor Structure of the Hindi Version of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale,2020,Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment,"The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) assesses emotion regulation among adults and adolescents, in healthy as well as clinical populations. However, its factor structure is a widely debated issue. Although earlier studies replicated the original six-factor structure, they pointed out psychometrically poor items in the DERS. The issue is further complicated by the findings of recent studies reporting a five- or even a four-factor structure of the DERS. Further, several studies have questioned the validity of the Awareness dimension of DERS and suggested excluding this dimension. Against this backdrop, the present study attempts to examine the factor structure of the Hindi version of the DERS (DERS-H) on 434 healthy participants (303 females, 131 males) of middle socio-economic status. Findings of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) did not support either of the one-, six- or five-factor solutions. After excluding five psychometrically poor items (poor loadings and higher standardized residuals), the CFA though yielded a satisfactory fit for first-order six-factor model, the second-order model did not fit well. However, after removing the Awareness dimension, the first-order as well as the second-order modified five-factor models provided apt fits to the data. This modified DERS-H (and its five sub-domains) showed satisfactory reliability and validity as well as factor structure invariance across gender and age. The findings suggest that the modified DERS-H is a psychometrically sound tool (with stable factor structure) to measure the second-order construct of emotion regulation difficulties as well as its five first-order subdomains, particularly in the Indian cultural context. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Confirmatory factor analysis; DERS-H; Difficulties in emotion regulation scale (DERS); Exploratory factor analysis; Factor structure; Five-factor model; Reliability; Six-factor model; Validity,"Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India; Department of Psychology, Amity University, Noida, 201313, India; Department of Psychology, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya, Bihar  824234, India",English
Mathiyazhagan S.,Participatory youth-led community development: A child-centered visual SWOT analysis in India,2020,Children and Youth Services Review,"In India, 27.5% of the population is youth in the age group of 15–29 years and 67.5% of the Indian population lives in rural and semi-urban areas. Youth civic engagements and youth-led initiatives are crucial for community development. The purpose of this paper is to examine how well youth-led initiatives are creating a positive impact in the community, as well as how these initiatives are recognized by their own community members and key stakeholders. This paper describes how youth-led visual technology and media-based community development processes transformed a nomadic tribal community in India with a focus on promoting child rights. The project “INaGi: A Child-Centered Visual SWOT” (Ilaingargaludan Nagaramum Giramamum, Tamil for “Youth with Urban and Rural Areas”) was executed by Trust for Youth and Child Leadership (TYCL), a youth-led organization based in Pondicherry, India. The project offered visual technology and media tools to local youth to capture the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the tribal community and provided space for them to reflect, connect, and act for mutual social transformation. This process recognizes indigenous knowledge, co-creation, and the power of young people and new age technology, and it enables local people to innovate local solutions for local problems. Furthermore, this paper discusses a youth-led bottom-up approach for the planning and execution of child-centered community development, as particularly distinct from a donor-driven project approach. Visual-based participatory action research methods were adopted to engage youth, community members, and other key stakeholders of the project. This paper captures the participatory youth-led community development process, its positive outcomes, and lessons learned from the process and put forth recommendations for key stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Child; Child-centered; Community-owned; Development; India; PAR; Visual SWOT; Youth-led,"Trust for Youth and Child Leadership (TYCL), India",English
"Sunil S., Verma S.K.",Development and Initial Validation of Perceived Moral Socialization Scale (PMSS),2020,Psychological Studies,"Although considerable research has underscored the role of parental socialization practices in the character building of youth, an adequate assessment tool to evaluate the youth’s perception of these practices is not available. This study reports the development and validation of the Perceived Moral Socialization Scale (PMSS). This multidimensional assessment tool assesses the emerging adult’s perception of the moral socialization practices employed by their parents, and, is useful for educators and institutions who seek to study the influence of parents on the moral development of youth. This instrument was administered as a validation study on a sample of 207 emerging adults (age 18–25). After the reliability and the validity analysis were conducted, four subscales were identified: demonstration of trust, moral discussions, inductive discipline, and moral action scaffolding. The scale also demonstrates good internal consistency reliability. These results indicate that PMSS is strong enough to be used for research seeking to understand the factors that contribute to youth wellbeing. © 2019, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Moral identity; Moral value socialization; Parenting; Perceived parental moral socialization scale,"Department of Psychology, University of Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Applied Psychology, Vivekananda College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, India",English
Pandya S.P.,Older Adults Who Meditate Regularly Perform Better on Neuropsychological Functioning and Visual Working Memory Tests: A Three-month Waitlist Control Design Study with a Cohort of Seniors in Assisted Living Facilities,2020,Experimental Aging Research,"Background: Neuropsychological functioning and visual working memory are vulnerable to age-related decline. This investigation examines the impact of meditation on the said outcomes for older adults in assisted living facilities. Older adults (N = 136) from four assisted living facilities in Mumbai and Pretoria were randomized into intervention and waitlist control groups. Method: The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was used as a screening instrument for recruitment (cutoff total index score = 86 ± 4). RBANS, the Simple Object Span Test (SOST), and the Picture Span Test (PST) were used to assess the outcomes. The intervention group underwent a 90-day meditation training complemented with self-practice. Results: Posttest scores of the intervention group were higher. Older adult men, with college degree, middle class, widowed, in fair health, with no diagnosed psychiatric conditions, who attended at least 70 (out of 90) meditation lessons and who self-practiced at least 70 times, gained more from the meditation intervention. Intervention compliance had the strongest effect on posttest outcomes as well as sex and psychiatric morbidities. Conclusion: Meditation intervention needs some refinements for older adult women, with high school education, upper class, currently married, in poor health, with diagnosed anxiety/depression/drug dependence, who attended fewer meditation lessons and self-practiced infrequently. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Deonar, Mumbai, India",English
"Ekstrand M.L., Raj T., Heylen E., Nyblade L., Devdass D., Pereira M., Mazur A., Srinivasan K.",Reducing HIV stigma among healthcare providers in India using a partly tablet-administered intervention: the DriSti trial,2020,AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV,"HIV stigma has long been recognized as a significant barrier in the worldwide fight against HIV. Across cultures, stigma has been shown to cause psychological distress and act as a barrier to engagement in care. Health professionals can serve as a crucial source of HIV stigma, with drivers that include fears and transmission misconceptions and pre-existing negative attitudes towards marginalized groups. To increase their impact, stigma reduction interventions need to be scalable and sustainable as well as adaptable to different cultural contexts. The DriSti intervention was designed to meet these needs through an easily adaptable, mostly tablet-administered, interactive intervention delivered to ward staff (n = 1,557) and nursing students (n = 1,625) in 62 Indian institutions, using a cRCT design, with wait-list controls. Six-month outcome analyses, showed significant reductions in misconceptions (p <.001) and worry about acquiring HIV at work (p <.001). Intervention participants also reported significantly greater reductions in endorsement of coercive policies (p <.001) and in the number of situations in which they intended to discriminate against PLWH (p <.001) than control participants. This brief, scaleable intervention could be adapted for similar populations in the region, using different mHealth platforms and thus has important implications for current global stigma reduction initiatives and training curricula. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",healthcare providers; HIV stigma; India; mHealth; nursing students; stigma intervention; ward staff,"Division of Prevention Sciences, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States; Division of Medical Informatics, St. John’s Research Institute, Bangalore, India; Global Health Division, International Development Group, RTI International, United States; Division of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Department of Psychiatry, St. John’s Research Institute, Bangalore, India",English

We adapted an adherence and psychosocial questionnaire into an electronic PRO format and administered it to a convenience sample of 50 participants. Almost all participants indicated that the PRO questionnaire was easy to complete and understand (96%). The percentage who needed any staff help was 83% among illiterate participants but only 13% among literate participants (p<0.001). In summary, an electronic PRO questionnaire was feasible and acceptable in an HIV care center in southern India.

Chakraborty S.,Embodying change at work: An autoethnography in the Indian public sector,2020,Qualitative Report,"Beyond the macro picture of change in the Indian public sector triggered by economic deregulation and restructuration, the variegated experiences of employees exposed to organizational changes remain hidden and masked. Through a reflexive inquiry about my experience of participating in a managerial implementation of a performance management system in an Indian public sector organization, I write this autoethnography to bring forward a personal narrative of embodying change at work. I do this by revealing how my cultural, social, and political experiences during that episode of change were manifestations of being and constituting organizationally intended as well as non-intended changes. The writing process involved in bringing out the personal narrative unravels the contours of my relationship with organizational actors such as the employees, the union, and the management, to eventually understand their impact on my experience of change. The narrative analysis of the ethnographic memoir has helped me consider my insider knowledge, realization, and reflection as opportunities to retell the macro (view of change) in terms of the interconnected individual subjectivities. Thus the autoethnographic effort is directed to tease out the associated meanings of embodying change at work by thinking with the narrative, rather than using the narrative to think. The broader goal of this inquiry is to draw ethnographic implications for working lives exposed to organizational changes.

Andrade C.,Nonfasting lipid profile may suffice to manage dyslipidemia,2020,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Patients with major mental illness and especially those who receive antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemia is part of the metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and other diseases. A fasting lipid profile is traditionally ordered to determine the need for and to monitor lipid-lowering treatment. However, a recent study showed that fasting and nonfasting lipid levels, obtained from the same patients, almost identically predicted hard 3-year cardiovascular event risks; the risks with fasting and nonfasting levels were closely similar in various secondary analyses, as well. This supports the stance of major medical associations in the field to accept nonfasting lipid levels to guide the treatment of dyslipidemia in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease events. © 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular disease; dyslipidemia; fasting lipids; metabolic syndrome; nonfasting lipids; primary prevention; secondary prevention,"Department of Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neurotoxicology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, 560 029, India",English
"Alafia J., Manjula M.",Emotion dysregulation and early trauma in borderline personality disorder: An exploratory study,2020,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) research is in its nascent stage in India though studies have estimated its prevalence in psychiatric conditions. Trauma experiences and emotion regulation difficulties are well documented in BPD in the international literature. Thus, it is imperative to examine the role of trauma experiences and their relation to emotion dysregulation in BPD in the Indian context. Materials and Methods: This study used both self-report and semistructured interview data from 34 adults with BPD who presented for outpatient or inpatient psychiatric treatment and compared them with a gender-matched control group. The tools used were the International Personality Disorder Examination, Kessler-10, Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form, modified-Positive And Negative Affect Scale, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Results: The BPD group reported higher negative affect, increased use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and a deficit of adaptive strategies, after depression scores were controlled for. General abuse, physical punishment, and emotional abuse were significantly higher in the BPD group. The high occurrence of childhood emotional abuse and negative affect in BPD patients emerged as a major correlate accounting for 68.4% of the variance in DERS scores. Conclusions: Although we obtained results similar to the western literature on BPD pathology, sociocultural factors such as family and economic conditions, cultural differences in symptom expression of BPD, and treatment forms used in India warrant further research. © 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Borderline personality; culture; early trauma; emotion dysregulation; emotional abuse,"Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Department of Clinical Psychology, Behavioral Medicine Unit, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

Limited studies have addressed the issues that affect the QoL in adolescents with cerebral palsy. The present study explores the parent-reported QoL in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Materials and Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, parental perspectives on QoL were investigated among 35 parents of adolescents with cerebral palsy, aged between 13 and 18 years. Performance on seven domains of QoL across age and gender were explored. Results: While the maximum QoL was seen in the domain of social well-being, the least QoL was noted for feelings about functioning. Across age, the early adolescence group (13-15 years) had a poorer quality of life in comparison to the late adolescence group (16-18 years). With respect to the gender, though females had a lower QoL scores, a statistically significant difference was observed only for the domain of general well-being and participation. Conclusions: From a parental perspective, the major issues of concern in adolescents with cerebral palsy were feelings about functioning, general well-being and participation, and access to services.

"Patel V., Varma J., Nimbalkar S., Shah S., Phatak A.","Prevalence and profile of bullying involvement among students of rural schools of anand, Gujarat, India",2020,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Bullying can have short- and long-term implications on physical as well as mental health. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of bullying involvement (bully, victim, and bully-victim) and know profiles of bullying among students of rural schools of Anand, Gujarat, in Western India. Materials and Methodology: A questionnaire in the Gujarati language was administered to sixth to tenth graders of 12 rural schools (n = 2552) in the Anand district. The questionnaire included four questions each to screen for bullying behavior and victim experiences; Peer Interaction in Primary Schools Questionnaire (PIPSQ, a self-reported measure of individuals' levels of bullying behaviors and victimization experiences), and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, to assess emotional, behavior, and interpersonal difficulties experienced), apart from demographic information. The analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Chi-square test was applied to determine associations. Results: Prevalence of bullying involvement was 70% (n = 1529; 9.1% bullies, 18.6% victims, and 42.3% bully-victims). The prevalence of bullies was higher in boys (77.5%) compared with girls (58.3%). In addition, the prevalence of victims was higher in boys (67.2%) compared with girls (51%). No association was found between various categories and family type, birth order, number of friends, or grade. Bully-victim was the worst affected group as per the SDQ profile. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of bullying-related involvement compared with earlier studies and a complete lack of bullying prevention policies at the school level. A simple screening strategy, using a few questions to identify bullying-related involvement, is valid and useful.

"Vats P., Das B., Khanra S.",Serum lipids among drug naïve or drug-free patients with obsessive compulsive disorder and their association with impulsivity: A comparative study,2020,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: The derangement of serum lipids is well documented in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, mania, and depression but not in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), where it has been inadequately examined. Also, serum lipid abnormalities are increasingly found in 'impulsivity,' an important sub-construct of OCD. Our study aimed to examine serum lipid profile among patients with OCD and its association with clinical profile and impulsivity among them. Methods: Forty drug naïve or drug-free (four weeks for oral and eight weeks for any depot psychotropics) patients with OCD according to International Classification of Disease -10th version (ICD-10): Diagnostic Criteria for Research (DCR) by the World Health Organization (WHO), from outpatient and inpatient departments of a tertiary care psychiatric hospital were recruited. Measures like Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamliton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Barratt's Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) were administered. Forty age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited after screening with General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). Serum lipids were assessed in both the groups. Results: Serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) (P &lt; 0.001; partial η2 = 0.176) and apolipoprotein B (P &lt; 0.001; partial η2 = 0.531) were significantly higher in OCD group than age- and sex-matched HC. A trend toward lower serum HDL (P = 0.06; partial η2 = 0.060) was observed among patients of OCD with high impulsivity. Serum HDL was negatively correlated with BIS attention (rs=-0.32; p = 0.03), BIS motor (rs= 0.40; P = 0.01), BIS non-planning (rs= -0.36; P = 0.02), and BIS total (rs= -0.36; P = 0.01) scores. Serum triglycerides (TG) (rs= 0.34; P = 0.03) and apolipoprotein B (rs= -0.32; P = 0.04) were negatively correlated with Y-BOCS compulsion score. Serum TG (rs= -0.45, P &lt; 0.01) and serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) was negatively (rs= -0.39; P = 0.01) correlated with Y-BOCS total scores. Serum VLDL was positively (rs= 0.34; P = 0.03) correlated with BIS motor scores. Conclusions: Serum lipid fractions are deranged among patients with OCD. Different lipid fractions have different associations with clinical profiles of OCD. Impulsivity among patients with OCD may have a specific association with serum lipids.

To address this issue, we have used semi-rational protein engineering to develop mEosBrite, a new class of improved brightness variants. The improvement in the brightness was confirmed by expression in E.coli as well as mammalian cell lines. Furthermore, biophysical characterization suggests that all the three mEosBrite variant proteins display higher quantum yield, truly monomeric form, less cytotoxicity and lower protein aggregation as compared to the wild type mEos3.2 protein. Most importantly, because of their high photoconversion efficiency mEosBrite variants could be an excellent tool for single-molecule and intensity fluctuation based super-resolution microscopy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Directed evolution; mEos3.2; Photoconvertible fluorescent protein; Super-resolution microscopy,"Department of Cell and Tumor Biology, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research & Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Tata Memorial Centre, Sector 22, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, MH  410210, India; Homi Bhabha National Institute, Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, MH  400085, India; Centre For Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India",English

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapies and mindfulness-based therapies can ameliorate anxiety in autism but cost-effective delivery remains a challenge. This pilot randomised controlled trial examined whether online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy self-help programmes could help reduce anxiety in 54 autistic adults who were randomly allocated to either an online cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 16) or mindfulness-based therapy (n = 19) programme or a waitlist control group (n = 19). Primary outcome measures of anxiety, secondary outcome measures of broader well-being and potential process of change variables were collected at baseline, after programme completion, and then 3 and 6 months post-completion. Baseline data confirmed that intolerance of uncertainty and emotional acceptance accounted for up to 61% of self-reported anxiety across all participants. The 23 participants who were retained in the active conditions (14 mindfulness-based therapies, 9 cognitive behaviour therapies) showed significant decreases in anxiety that were maintained over 3, and to some extent also 6 months. Overall, results suggest that online self-help cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy tools may provide a cost-effective method for delivering mental health support to those autistic adults who can engage effectively with online support tools. Lay abstract: Anxiety in autism is an important target for psychological therapies because it is very common and because it significantly impacts upon quality of life and well-being. Growing evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapies and mindfulness-based therapies can help autistic individuals learn to manage feelings of anxiety but access to such therapies remains problematic. In the current pilot study, we examined whether existing online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy self-help tools can help reduce anxiety in autistic adults. Specifically, 35 autistic adults were asked to try either an existing online cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 16) or mindfulness-based therapy (n = 19) programme while a further 19 autistic adults served as a waitlist comparison group. A first important finding was that 23 of the 35 (66%) participants who tried the online tools completed them, suggesting that such tools are, in principle, acceptable to many autistic adults. In addition, adults in the cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy conditions reported significant decreases in anxiety over 3 and to some extent also 6 months that were less apparent in the waitlist group of participants. On broader measures of mental health and well-being, the benefits of the online tools were less apparent. Overall, the results suggest that online self-help cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy tools should be explored further as a means of providing cost-effective mental health support to at least those autistic individuals who can engage effectively with such online tools. © The Author(s) 2020.",anxiety; autism; cognitive-behavioural therapy; mindfulness; online,"City, University of London, London, United Kingdom; King’s College London, United Kingdom; MAPS Psychology, India; University of Westminster, United Kingdom; Newcastle University, United Kingdom; Brigham Young University, United States",English

The important role of histone acetylation is well established in these processes. However, activity-dependent regulation of acetylation of non-histone proteins is not well understood. We previously showed that α-tubulin is acetylated in an activity-dependent manner. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) plays an important role in α-tubulin acetylation induced by KCl depolarization or N-methyl-D-aspartate stimulation of the hippocampal slices. In addition, KCl depolarization inhibits the activity of SIRT2, an α-tubulin deacetylase. The inhibitory effect of KCl on SIRT2 activity requires CDK5 activity. Furthermore, α-tubulin acetylation is enhanced by memory training in object recognition task. These results suggest that memory formation may involve α-tubulin acetylation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Cyclin-dependent kinase 5; Memory; Object recognition task; SIRT2; α-tubulin,"National Brain Research Centre, Manesar, Haryana  122052, India",English

The fluorescent sensing of metal ions by a new ligand prepared (L = 4-[{4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl]imino}methyl]piperazine-1-carboxaldehyde) has been investigated as well as the effect of the supramolecular complex formation with β-CD. In aqueous solution, L shows an increase of fluorescence due to the interaction with β-cyclodextrin with a formation constant of 77 (± 12) M−1. The ROESY NMR spectrum clearly indicates that L is encapsulated by β-CD. Theoretical calculations show the possible structure both of the L-β-CD adduct and of the coordination mode of Al3+ ion to L. In the presence of β-CD, the piperazine adopts a distorted conformation. It leads to an enhanced Al3+ sensing by the compound in its supramolecular complexed form.

Monastic debate is an interactive and dyadic analytical meditation practice that originates from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition where monastics seek to jointly deepen their understanding of complicated philosophical issues. To date, monastic debate and analytic meditation have yet to be examined in the context of scientific investigation. Methods: In the current study, we examined the neural correlates of this analytical meditation practice by means of hyperscanning electroencephalography, a method well-suited for examining social interactions. Results: Consistent with the idea that analytical meditation helps to train concentration, we observed that over the course of the debate, mid-frontal theta oscillations—a correlate of absorption—increased significantly. This increase was stronger for more experienced monks as compared with monks at the beginning of their education. In addition, we found evidence for increases in synchrony in frontal alpha oscillations between paired debaters during moments of agreement as compared with disagreement on a set of premises. Conclusions: Together, these findings provide an initial understanding of Tibetan monastic debate and analytical meditation using neuroscientific methods. © 2020, The Author(s).",Analytical meditation; Concentration; Hyperscanning; Meditation; Monastic debate; Tibetan Buddhism,"Institute of Artificial Intelligence &#x0026; Cognitive Engineering, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; Bernoulli Institute of Mathematics, Computer Science &#x0026; Artificial Intelligence, Nijenborgh 9, Groningen, 9747 AG, Netherlands; Department of Sociology, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States; Science for Monks, Palo Alto, CA, United States; Sera Jey Monastic University, Bylakuppe, India; Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, Dharamsala, India; Department of Psychology, University of Berne, Bern, Switzerland; Department of Psychological Sciences, Kent State University, Kent, OH, United States",English

We yearn to make our life meaningful and have a proper understanding of the meaning of words and worlds, which help us in blossoming of life rather than being trapped in labyrinths of confusion and annihilated in varieties of killing and destruction. But this fundamental yearning for meaning has always been under stress in different periods and epochs of human history. In our contemporary world, we are also going through stress, vis-à-vis the work of meanings in our lives, which is part of a global crisis of meaning. Our global crisis of meaning has multiple genealogies. Our contemporary crisis of meaning has its roots in both the way we relate to language and our worlds, which is discussed in this article. It also discusses how we can cultivate new movements and circles of meaning generation. This is linked to vision and practices of upholding our world and regenerating our earth. I then link processes of meaning generation to processes of coming together of people as well as soul, what is called Lokasamgraha in Indic tradition. I discuss how the global crisis of meaning calls for new cosmopolitan movements as well as building a planetary Lokasamgraha. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",Dharma; Lokasamgraha of meaning; multi-topial hermeneneutics; sahadharma; satyagraha,"Madras Institute of Development Studies, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",English
"Choudhary S., Gupta R.",Culture and Borderline Personality Disorder in India,2020,Frontiers in Psychology,"The present paper discusses how cultural context can be used as an essential tool in the diagnosis of mental disorders as well as in segregating individuals with normal or abnormal personality functioning. Further, such information about the culture can be used to diagnose individuals specifically with borderline personality disorder (BPD). BPD is a mental illness marked by impulsivity and instability in interpersonal relationships, moods, and self-image. We discuss how culture shapes patterns of behavior in the individual with BPD. An extensive review of manifestation of BPD in eastern countries suggests that culture and social norms are the two crucial factors, which can differentiate normal and abnormal behavioral patterns in BPD. For example, the social norms shape and give directions to our interpersonal functioning, emotions are experienced within the cultural context and expressed accordingly, and self is a reflection and representation of one’s culture. Hence, these constructs of BPD (such as interpersonal functioning, emotions, and self) indicate that they are experienced differently in different cultures and vary on the continuum of normal to abnormal personality functioning. The cultural manifestation of BPD helps to understand the specific profile of the three constructs of BPD in an eastern culture like India. A synthesis of studies on prevalence, development, and symptom presentation of BPD in the Indian context is emphasized to support the personality functioning within the constructs of BPD. The literature review indicates that BPD research in India is based only on a few cases and a tiny sample of such patients. However, studies on BPD in the cultural context are minimal and incomprehensive. Hence, it suggests the importance of more empirical studies concerning the appropriate diagnosis of BPD within the cultural context of India. © Copyright © 2020 Choudhary and Gupta.",borderline personality disorder; BPD in India; culture and BPD; normal and abnormal personality; personality functioning within cultural context,"Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India; Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India",English

This was an intervention experiment that spanned 5 weeks and included three measurement occasions (weeks 1, 3, 5) and two separate deliveries of the forgiveness intervention (weeks 2 and 4). Participants were N = 124 students at Karnatak University in Darwha, India (100 Hindu; 18 Muslim, 5 Christian, and 1 Jain). This was a manualized, secular intervention led by a trained facilitator in a group, psychoeducational format. Measures included forgiveness and unforgiveness as well as assessments of positive and negative affective states and spirituality. Participants who received immediate forgiveness training showed significant and large positive changes in forgiveness and unforgiveness, as well as, more positive affect and increased self-esteem in contrast to wait-list comparisons. Perceiving one’s offender as having a similar spirituality to oneself was a consistent predictor of response to the REACH Forgiveness program. Specifically, perceiving the offender as having a similar spirituality was related to less growth of unforgiveness and more growth in empathy, positive affect, and emotional forgiveness as a result of the psychoeducational program. The REACH Forgiveness psychoeducational approach is efficacious in an Indian college student sample, and some relational spirituality variables are important predictors of response to the program. Future studies should consider the role of Indian culture in promoting forgiveness and possibly tailor the intervention to suit the significant proportions of Hindus and Muslims in India. © Copyright © 2020 Toussaint, Worthington, Cheadle, Marigoudar, Kamble and Büssing.",forgiveness; forgiveness training; India; psychoeducation; REACH Forgiveness; well-being; wellness,"Department of Psychology, Luther College, Decorah, IA, United States; Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States; Department of Psychology, Hope College, Holland, MI, United States; Department of Psychology, Karnatak University, Darwha, India; Quality of Life, Spirituality and Coping, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Witten/Herdecke University, Herdecke, Germany",English

In line with this general trend, inter-disciplinary approaches have been taken to automate the recognition of emotions in adults or children for the benefit of various applications, such as identification of children's emotions prior to a clinical investigation. Within this context, it turns out that automating emotion recognition is far from being straightforward, with several challenges arising for both science (e.g., methodology underpinned by psychology) and technology (e.g., the iMotions biometric research platform). In this paper, we present a methodology and experiment and some interesting findings, which raise the following research questions for the recognition of emotions and attention in humans: (a) the adequacy of well-established techniques such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), (b) the adequacy of state-of-the-art biometric research platforms, (c) the extent to which emotional responses may be different in children and adults. Our findings and first attempts to answer some of these research questions are based on a mixed sample of adults and children who took part in the experiment, resulting in a statistical analysis of numerous variables.

However, the original data on which each perspective relies are decades old, and the literature is fraught with conflicting methods, analyses, results, and conclusions. Using a new 45-country sample (N = 14,399), we attempted to replicate classic studies and test both the evolutionary and biosocial role perspectives. Support for universal sex differences in preferences remains robust: Men, more than women, prefer attractive, young mates, and women, more than men, prefer older mates with financial prospects. Cross-culturally, both sexes have mates closer to their own ages as gender equality increases.

"Yadav H., Vaidya A., Shukla V., Husain S.",Word Order Typology Interacts With Linguistic Complexity: A Cross-Linguistic Corpus Study,2020,Cognitive Science,"Much previous work has suggested that word order preferences across languages can be explained by the dependency distance minimization constraint (Ferrer-i Cancho, 2008, 2015; Hawkins, 1994). Consistent with this claim, corpus studies have shown that the average distance between a head (e.g., verb) and its dependent (e.g., noun) tends to be short cross-linguistically (Ferrer-i Cancho, 2014; Futrell, Mahowald, & Gibson, 2015; Liu, Xu, & Liang, 2017). This implies that on average languages avoid inefficient or complex structures for simpler structures. But a number of studies in psycholinguistics (Konieczny, 2000; Levy & Keller, 2013; Vasishth, Suckow, Lewis, & Kern, 2010) show that the comprehension system can adapt to the typological properties of a language, for example, verb-final order, leading to more complex structures, for example, having longer linear distance between a head and its dependent. In this paper, we conduct a corpus study for a group of 38 languages, which were either Subject–Verb–Object (SVO) or Subject–Object–Verb (SOV), in order to investigate the role of word order typology in determining syntactic complexity. We present results aggregated across all dependency types, as well as for specific verbal (objects, indirect objects, and adjuncts) and nonverbal (nominal, adjectival, and adverbial) dependencies. The results suggest that dependency distance in a language is determined by the default word order of a language, and crucially, the direction of a dependency (whether the head precedes the dependent or follows it; e.g., whether the noun precedes the verb or follows it). Particularly we show that in SOV languages (e.g., Hindi, Korean) as well as SVO languages (e.g., English, Spanish), longer linear distance (measured as number of words) between head and dependent arises in structures when they mirror the default word order of the language. In addition to showing results on linear distance, we also investigate the influence of word order typology on hierarchical distance (HD; measured as number of heads between head and dependent). The results for HD are similar to that of linear distance. At the same time, in comparison to linear distance, the influence of adaptability on HD seems less strong. In particular, the results show that most languages tend to avoid greater structural depth. Together, these results show evidence for “limited adaptability” to the default word order preferences in a language. Our results support a large body of work in the processing literature that highlights the importance of linguistic exposure and its interaction with working memory constraints in determining sentence complexity. Our results also point to the possible role of other factors such as the morphological richness of a language and a multifactor account of sentence complexity remains a promising area for future investigation. © 2020 Cognitive Science Society, Inc",Corpus linguistics; Dependency treebanks; Language adaptation; Language typology; Quantitative linguistics; Working memory constraints,"Centre for Linguistics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, India; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India",English

Innovative approaches are needed to develop and disseminate scalable mental health interventions, especially for youth in low- and middle-income countries. Computerized single-session interventions (SSIs) may be able to overcome many of these implementation barriers, especially if deployed in school settings. Methods: Guided by this logic, we designed three computerized SSIs (based on behavioral activation, gratitude, and growth mindset exercises) for delivery in Indian high schools. Then, we conducted focus groups with Indian adolescents and school officials to inform adaptations of the interventions. Finally, we designed a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the interventions. Results: In this paper, we present the rationale for selecting the interventions, the results of the focus groups, and the design of a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study. Our initial focus group data showed that the interventions were considered acceptable, feasible, and appropriate by both educators and students. We also describe feedback on the interventions which we incorporated to refine the interventions prior to our randomized controlled trial. Discussion: Computerized SSIs may offer innovative, scalable ways to disseminate evidence-based interventions. By identifying which interventions are most acceptable and effective in this highly scalable format, we may understand which SSIs are best suited for continued development, testing, and, ultimately, widespread dissemination. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Adolescents; Digital mental health; Global mental health; SSI; Well-being,"Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, United States; Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, United States; Department of Psychology, Harvard University, United States; Population Council, New Delhi, India; Department of Psychology, Modern College of Arts and Sciences, Pune, India; Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University, United States",English
"Mahapatro M., Singh S.P.","Coping strategies of women survivors of domestic violence residing with an abusive partner after registered complaint with the family counseling center at Alwar, India",2020,Journal of Community Psychology,"Coping is one of the most important and widely studied aspects of domestic violence (DV). Women adopt a wide variety of coping strategies to manage abuse, ranging from individual estrangement to institutional entitlements. The condition of women becomes complex when they seek institutional support while living with an abusive husband and his family under the common hearth. The present study aims to analyze the coping strategy of mediation between informal and formal justice while residing with an abusive husband and his family. Further, the study explores the coping strategy as an outcome of the contextual factor and associated psychological distress. It is a prospective intervention study with a 4-month span building awareness, counseling (individual, couple, and family counseling), and case-specific advice (safety plan, choice-making, and problem-solving). A baseline and endline assessment with SRQ-20 and in-depth interviews were carried out on 299 married women who had registered a complaint with a family counseling center (FCC); Mahila Suraksha Evam Salah Kendra (MSSK) in Alwar district, India. To understand the context and the coping strategy adopted by women, in-depth interviews were carried out. The results show that there is a differential impact of DV, psychological distress, and coping strategy based on contextual factor; women having an informal support system have a better result in coping; and intervention at the formal system resulted in improving coping strategy and simultaneously reducing psychological distress. As the mediation period is interminable and traumatic, the institutional support to women survivors of DV is an important policy alternative for improving survivors’ well-being, especially in an unsupportive informal context. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi, India; School of Public Policy & Governance, MDI Gurugram, Gurgaon, Haryana, India",English
"Papa A., Mital M., Pisano P., Del Giudice M.",E-health and wellbeing monitoring using smart healthcare devices: An empirical investigation,2020,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 (SDG – Goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS – SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Healthcare computing; Healthcare systems; Innovation management; Internet of things; RFID; Smart cities; Smart healthcare,"Department of Informatics, University of Turin, Via Pessinetto, 12, Torino, 10149, Italy; Great lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, India; University of Rome “Link Campus”, Via del Casale di S.

However, a male advantage in decision making is observed in animal as well as human models of the iowa gambling task (IGT), and, in case of the latter, the difference is observed across a wide range of age groups. It is unclear if these sex differences on the IGT are malleable to environmental influences such as sociocultural factors. We tested sex differences during the uncertainty and risk phases of the IGT in data pooled from three countries that reflected high, moderate, to low gender-equity (Germany, United States, and India: N = 531, female = 269). Comparing the net scores in uncertainty vs. risk blocks (first two vs. last two blocks) confirmed the male-advantage on the IGT across the three countries, specifically in the risk blocks, with the highest male-advantage observed for Germany. Results are discussed in terms of sex differences in reaction to uncertainty vs. risk, and the counter-intuitive effect of gender-equitable environment suggesting that national/environmental factors might influence advantageous decision making, but in ways that accentuate rather than abate sex differences. © Copyright © 2020 Singh, Schiebener, Müller, Liebherr, Brand and Buelow.",decision making; gender; iowa gambling task; risk; sex differences; uncertainty,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; Department of General Psychology Cognition, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany; Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Newark, OH, United States",English
"Singh V., Mutreja V.","Enhancing Executive Control: Attention to Balance, Breath, and the Speed Versus Accuracy Tradeoff",2020,Frontiers in Psychology,"Malleability of executive control and its enhancement through yoga training is unclear. In Study 1, participants (yoga group; n = 27, mean = 23.27 years) were tested on executive control tasks pre- and post-8 weeks of yoga training. The training focused on attention to postural control during yoga asanas and respiratory control during pranayama-breathing (30 min each of postural and breath control training, biweekly). Yoga training was assessed via performance ratings as to how well a posture was executed and by examining errors that reflected inattention/failures in postural and breath control. We also explored whether attentional demands on motor and respiratory control were associated with three components of executive control (working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition) during nine executive control tasks. Partial correlation results revealed that the three components of executive control might be differentially impacted by postural and breath control and selectively associated with either speed or accuracy (except for cognitive flexibility). Attentional demands influenced the link between postural, breath, and cognitive control. In Study 2, comparisons between a yoga group and a gender-matched control group (control group; n = 27, mean = 23.33 years) pointed toward higher working memory accuracy and a better speed–accuracy tradeoff in inhibitory control in the yoga group. A ceiling-practice effect was addressed by examining yoga practice learning (i.e., practice-induced change in postural and breath control reflected in ratings and errors) on executive control performance across two sets of tasks: repeatedly tested (pre- and post-8 weeks) and non-repeatedly tested (post-8 weeks). Attention to motor and respiratory control during yoga might be considered as a potential mechanism through which specific components of executive control in young adults might be enhanced potentially via altering of speed–accuracy tradeoff. © Copyright © 2020 Singh and Mutreja.",attention; breath control; executive control; posture; speed–accuracy; yoga,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India; Toronto Western Hospital, Krembil Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada",English

"Gupta A., Sidana A.",Clinical hypnotherapy in grief resolution-A case report,2020,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Grief is one's reaction to any loss, and the coping mechanisms during grief either deplete or become maladaptive. One of the common ways to cope with grief is alcohol or substance intake. The course and resolution of grief vary depending upon many factors. Hypnotherapy has been useful and effective in addressing grief reactions as well as associated manifestation, such as sleep problems, depressive features, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It might be a good choice of treatment while dealing with patients having underlying issues or maladaptive coping mechanisms. This is a single case study design hypothesized to indicate maladaptive coping of increased alcohol consumption to deal with the death of a young son. The case had been treated as alcohol dependent syndrome with multiple hospitalizations without addressing underlying grief. The treatment approach was changed, and grief was addressed using hypnotherapy. Clinical hypnotherapy helped address grief and facilitated the index case to accept the loss. This resulted in minimizing hospitalizations, abstinence and improved day-to-day functioning along with the use of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the loss.

"Sen A.K., Bagchi A., Chakraborty S.",Designing information feedback for bidders in multi-item multi-unit combinatorial auctions,2020,Decision Support Systems,"Combinatorial auctions (CAs) promote allocative efficiency and are important market mechanisms for a wide variety of specialized domains where bidders are allowed to place bids on packages of items. However, the adoption of combinatorial auctions in real-life business scenarios has been fairly limited, perhaps because bidders find it difficult to construct their bids without extensive knowledge of the current state of the auction. In this paper, we develop decision support tools for bidders to provide information feedback at runtime for the general class of combinatorial auctions namely, online (continuous) multi-item multi-unit combinatorial auctions (MUCAs), an area that has witnessed a rapid growth of interest in recent years. In online MUCAs the number of packages may be large, and bidders need real time decision support to construct their bids, such as information on the ask prices of packages. The deadness level of a package serves as the ask price, and indicates the minimum bid on the package that keeps it in contention for inclusion in winning combinations in future. It has proved a challenge to find a satisfactory method for computing the deadness levels of packages in MUCAs. Here we present exact methods for determining package deadness levels in such auctions. Both the OR and the XOR formulations are considered. Experiments on simulated data as well as on live data show that the time and memory requirements are not excessive, so it appears possible to adopt the methods for the procurement and sale of commodities in B2B and B2C markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Continuous combinatorial auctions; Electronic markets; Multi-unit auctions; Real-time bidder support,"Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, India; Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India",English
"Jha A., Saha D.","“Forecasting and analysing the characteristics of 3G and 4G mobile broadband diffusion in India: A comparative evaluation of Bass, Norton-Bass, Gompertz, and logistic growth models”",2020,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"An empirical understanding of countrywide diffusion of third (3G) or/and fourth (4G) generations of Mobile Broadband Services (MBSs) has proven implications for both business and policy of the country. However, extant literature lacks in explanation for the diffusion and forecast of these services in India. We address this gap by analyzing both individual and multigenerational diffusions of 3G and 4G services in India, using Bass, Gompertz, Logistic and Norton-Bass models that utilize a mix of linear and non-linear regression techniques. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of several exogenous variables on the diffusion of those MBSs in India. Our analyses reveal that, firstly in case of diffusion, Bass model estimates are quite sensitive to both 3G and 4G historical data, whereas Gompertz and Logistic models fit well with the same dataset. As expected, Norton-Bass model - encompassing all the successive generations of 2G, 3G and 4G - provides more reliable estimates of the diffusion parameters. Secondly, as far as 3G forecast is concerned, Bass model works better with fixed assumptions of ultimate market potential, whereas Gompertz and Logistic models seem to be more suited for ‘optimistic’ long-range forecasts and ‘conservative’ short-term forecasts, respectively. Our results also show that 4G is diffusing at 6.1 times the speed of 3G diffusion in India, when the total MBS subscription in India is likely to reach 410 million by 2026. Finally, we notice that, among the notable external sources of influence, National Telecom Policy 2012, average revenue per user, and aggregate income variables have significant positive impacts on the diffusion of MBSs in India. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",3G; 4G; Diffusion models; Gompertz model; Logistic model; Norton-Bass model,"S.

Study objectives were attained through semi-structured interviews with 20 college faculty/administrators and five focus group discussions with 64 students across 16 colleges in a metropolitan city in South India. The need and relevance of a program for mental health promotion were endorsed by all the participants, and it was considered feasible with prior planning. Suggestions for potential content of such a program included mental health awareness, dealing with depression and anxiety, managing negative emotions, managing pressures and temptations, improving self-confidence, reflection and clarity about life goals, cultivating sense of gratitude, broadening other orientation, and time management skills. The content of intervention perceived as important by the two groups of stakeholders highlighted the broad convergences between the potential themes being considered by the researchers and the stakeholder views. Potential receptivity to the program was considered to be good though it was perceived to be influenced by the awareness about the importance of such a program. Suboptimal interest of college authority and/or students and competing academics and other programs were identified as potential challenges to program implementation.

"Hiebler-Ragger M., Kamble S.V., Aberer E., Unterrainer H.F.",The relationship between existential well-being and mood-related psychiatric burden in Indian young adults with attachment deficits: A cross-cultural validation study,2020,BMC Psychology,"Background: Attachment and spirituality are thought to have deep evolutionary roots but are always interpreted within the framework of culture, religion and personal beliefs. While insecure attachment has been observed to be positively related with psychopathology, a positive mental health effect has often been described for spirituality. To examine the cross-cultural validation of previous research focused on Austrian young adults with Western socialization, we attempt to replicate our study examining the influence spirituality has on the connection between insecure attachment and mood-related psychiatric burden with Indian young adults. Methods: We investigated Avoidant (AV) and Anxious (AX) Attachment (ECR-RD), Religious (RWB) and Existential (EWB) Well-Being (MI-RSWB), and mood-related psychiatric burden (Anxiety, Depression, Somatization; BSI-18) in 443 (31% female) Indian young adults (age range: 18-30 years) with a Hindu upbringing. Results: Compared to young adults with a Roman Catholic upbringing in a Western socialization, Indian participants did not differ in AX and EWB but scored higher in mood-related psychiatric burden (eta 2 =.04), AV (eta 2 =.14), as well as RWB (eta 2 =.28; all p &lt;.01). As in previous research only AX (β =.40) positively predicted mood-related psychiatric burden (ΔR 2 =.15, all p &lt;.01), while EWB was an additional negative predictor (β =-.11, p &lt;.05). Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the universal importance of attachment and spirituality for mental health as well as the potential influence of socialization on their development. Furthermore, they underline that Existential Well-Being-including hope for a better future, forgiveness, and the experience of sense and meaning- A ppears to have a compensating effect on the relation between insecure attachment and impaired mental health. © 2020 The Author(s).",Attachment; Mental health; Mood-related psychiatric burden; Spirituality; Young adults,"Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine, Medical University Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 31, Graz, A-8036, Austria; Center for Integrative Addiction Research, Grüner Kreis Society, Rudolfsplatz 9, Vienna, A-1010, Austria; Department of Psychology, Karnatak University, Pavate Nagar, Dharwad, Karnataka, 580003, India; Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 8, Graz, A-8036, Austria; Department of Religious Studies, University of Vienna, Schenkenstrae 8-10/5th floor, Vienna, A-1010, Austria",English
"Jehanzeb K., Mohanty J.",The mediating role of organizational commitment between organizational justice and organizational citizenship behavior: Power distance as moderator,2020,Personnel Review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between organizational justice and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) while considering the mediating effect of organizational commitment and the moderating role of power distance on this association. Design/methodology/approach: Using a stratified sampling technique the data were collected from the employees working in bank branches located in five metropolitan cities (i.e. Islamabad, Peshawar, Lahore, Quetta and Karachi) of Pakistan. A total of 409 responses were received and 379 questionnaires were considered for analysis. To test the hypotheses structural equation modeling technique was applied using AMOS 21.0. Findings: The results reported an insignificant relationship between organizational justice and OCB, but the relationship between organizational justice and organizational commitment was found to be significant. It has also emerged from the analysis that organizational commitment fully mediates the relationship between organizational justice and OCB. Moreover, power distance was found to moderate the relationship between organizational justice and organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications: Findings of this study can be useful for banking organizations and policy makers responsible for employee productivity and overall employee well-being, particularly managers working on long-term organizational vision and expect employees to respond pro-socially toward fellow workers and organizational objectives. The study also provides the scope and space for potential scholars and researchers for carrying out further research. Practical implications: Findings of this study can be useful for banking organizations and policy makers who have long-term vision and expect OCB from its employees to be sustainable in a dynamic market. The study also provides the scope and space for potential scholars and researchers for carrying out further research. Originality/value: While extensive literature is available on organizational justice and its impact on OCB, very little work seems to have been done to examine the moderating impact of power distance between organizational justice and organizational commitment, particularly in the context of a developing country like Pakistan. Therefore, this work may be considered as original and of significant value in understanding the relationships between the various constructs in the scenario of Pakistan. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Commitment; Organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB); Organizational justice; Power; Quantitative,"Department of Management Sciences, GIFT University, Gujranwala, Pakistan; Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad, India",English
Sudha R.,"Gayathri mantra and social skills training for social anxiety, stress, self concept, and well being among school students with learning difficulties",2020,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"Gayathri Mantra is a four verse poem that was mentioned in epics of Hinduism and has been further researched for its lasting effect on mind and body. Here an attempt is being made to combine the healing effects of Gayathri mantra along with Social Skills Training for benefitting the often ignored psychological issues such as Social Anxiety, Self Concept and Well Being faced by school students with Learning Difficulties. Objectives The major objectives of the study are to understand the level of Social Anxiety, Stress, Self concept and Well being among school students with learning difficulties. An effort to improve the Self concept, Well being and to reduce the level of Social Anxiety and Stress experienced using an intervention of Social Skills Training along with the chanting/listening of Gayathri Mantra with simple Breathing Exercises. Method The Liebowitz Social anxiety Scale (Liebowitz M R, 1987) was used to pretest the Social Anxiety levels. The Perceived Stress Scale for Children (White, B P, 2014) was used to study the stress levels of students. The Self Concept Questionnaire (SCQ, Saraswat, R.K) was used to pretest the self concept and the WHO Well Being Scale was used to pretest the well being among 80 school students of the age group 10 to 17 years. This group was then randomly divided into 2 groups of 40 members each, hence 40 students in the Experimental Group and 40 students in the wait list Control Group. This was followed by an intervention of Social Skills Training Module and the chanting/listening of Gayathri Mantra for a duration of two months. A post test was conducted and the results analyzed. A follow Up study was also conducted after two months. Results and conclusions The SPSS 21 version was used to analyze obtained data. Analysis showed that the intervention of Social Skills Training and Gayathri Mantra was effective in reducing the Social Anxiety and Stress levels of the Experimental Group. Also post intervention, an improvement especially in the Self Concept was observed in the students of the experimental Group. The Well being level also shows improvement. These results were found to be maintained during the follow up study. It can be effectively concluded that the intervention of Social Skills Training with Gayathri Mantra is effective in reducing Social Anxiety and Stress among students with Learning Difficulties.

"Manohar H., Kandasamy P., Chandrasekaran V., Rajkumar R.P.",Can RCTs capture it all?—Need for qualitative studies on parent-mediated interventions for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,2020,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Introduction: There is a global rise in the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and treatment gap exists across settings. In low-resource settings, there is a lack of professionals and specialist centres for intervention delivery. ‘Parent-mediated interventions’ is an essential strategy to bridge the existing treatment gap. While RCTs are required to establish evidence base, understanding parental perspectives is pivotal in designing culturally-relevant intervention models, to enhance parental involvement and sustainability. The current paper focuses on the results of a qualitative study to understand the parent perspectives and change process before and after a parent-mediated intervention program. Methods: 30 children (2–6 years) recently diagnosed to have ASD, participated in a brief parent-mediated interventions focusing on core-deficits, for 12 weeks. Parents were asked to narrate their experiences and perception of their child's disorder and interventions before and after the intervention program, during one-on-one in-depth interview. A narrative guide was used to generate response. The narratives were recorded verbatim and thematic content analysis was carried out. Results: Repetitive themes reflecting impact of the child's disorder, treatment impact and change process was examined. The broad themes generated included: 1) Change in perception of the child's developmental disorder after involvement in intervention process. 2) Change in parental attitudes from ‘lack of hope’ to ‘positive and appropriate expectations’ 3) Gain in knowledge and empowerment 4) Stress reduction 5) Appreciation of micro-gains 6) Validation of ‘hands-on training’. Behavioural interventions were the preferred treatment of choice in 66 % of parents, followed by combination therapy in 22 % and pharmacotherapy alone in 12 %. Conclusion: Parent's narratives highlighted the acceptability and feasibility of the parent-mediated interventions in our cultural setting. Understanding parental perspectives, more so when interventions are parent-mediated, is essential for tailoring interventions as well as improving sustainability. © 2019",Autism; India; Intervention; Narrative; Parent-mediated; Qualitative,"Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India; Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605 006, India",English
"Vaidyanathan S., Rajan T.M., Chandrasekaran V., Kandasamy P.",Pre-school attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: 12 weeks prospective study,2020,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Introduction: Extant literature lack studies on behavioural training or pharmacotherapy in Indian preschool children. With adverse long term outcomes, effective, safe and affordable early interventions for ADHD are a priority. Aim of this prospective study is to report on short term outcome of preschool ADHD with specific focus on safety and tolerability of medications. Methods: Children with ADHD aged 2.5–6 years were assessed for severity and adverse events at baseline and follow-up using Conner's abbreviated rating scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale. Children with Autism spectrum disorder and those with social quotient less than 50 were excluded. Statistical Analysis included descriptive statistics and Repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Of 56 children recruited, 33.93 %(N = 19) were on behavioural interventions alone, 66.07 %(N = 37) were on a combination of medication and behavioural intervention. All children received treatment according to standard care. The most prescribed drug was clonidine (44.64%), then risperidone (28.7%), methylphenidate (10.7%) and atomoxetine (10.7%). Medication choice was determined by affordability, availability and comorbidity profile. Sedation occurred in 24 % of children on clonidine. Atomoxetine was not well tolerated in 2 children. Methylphenidate was well tolerated. Irrespective of medication choice, all children showed significant improvement at 12 weeks (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Choice of interventions is largely determined by availability and affordability. There is a need for structured parent behavioural training program deliverable in low resource setting. Anti-ADHD medications should be made available under the NMHP, RBSK program and all government settings in India, to address over-prescription of antipsychotics in preschool ADHD. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",ADHD; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Pharmacotherapy; Preschool,"Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences, Bangalore, India; Department of Pediatrics, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India",English
"Kuanr A., Pradhan D., Chaudhuri H.R.","I (do not) consume; therefore, I am: Investigating materialism and voluntary simplicity through a moderated mediation model",2020,Psychology and Marketing,"With the burgeoning of consumer culture and materialism on a global scale, a counter-culture movement, namely, voluntary simplicity, is slowly gaining currency. Extant research reveals a degree of disparateness in the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity. Drawing on the value-basis theory and anti-consumption research, the current study attempts at an unorthodox study of the fledgling culture of anti-consumption in urban India. The paper empirically examines the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity in India. This research, through an experimental study followed by a sample survey, conducted among urban Indian consumers, examines how satisfaction with life, self-efficacy, and individualism interact with materialistic values to eventually influence voluntary simplicity attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 74 working professionals), we experimentally triggered materialistic aspirations and evaluated their effects on voluntary simplicity in comparison to a control condition. In Study 2 (N = 315), individuals self-rated their materialistic values, satisfaction with life, self-efficacy, cultural orientation, and voluntary simplicity attitude. Our study, contrary to the suggestions in the existing literature, demonstrates that materialists espouse voluntary simplicity attitudes when environmental degradation around them directly impacts their health, wealth, and well-being. In addition to the positive direct effect, satisfaction with life and self-efficacy serially mediate the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity, providing a welcome divergence from dark-sided conceptualizations of materialism. Our results help global marketers, and public policymakers better understand the interaction between materialistic values and sustainable consumption attitudes, in the developing country perspective. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",anti-consumption; India; individualism; materialism; satisfaction with life; self-efficacy; voluntary simplicity,"Department of Marketing, Xavier School of Management, XLRI, Jamshedpur, India",English
"Simione L., Raffone A., Mirolli M.","Stress as the Missing Link Between Mindfulness, Sleep Quality, and Well-being: a Cross-sectional Study",2020,Mindfulness,"Objectives: There is ample evidence that mindfulness contributes to psychological well-being. There is also evidence that mindfulness can improve sleep, and previous research has suggested that the positive effects of mindfulness on well-being may depend on its capacity to decrease sleep disturbances. However, it is possible that a third factor that is affected by mindfulness may in turn affect both sleep quality and well-being. Given the well-known protective effects of mindfulness on stress and the influence of stress on both sleep disturbance and well-being, stress represents a strong candidate for such a mediational role. Methods: We collected cross-sectional data on mindfulness, stress, sleep disturbance, and well-being in a sample of adults taken from the general population, and then we applied structural equation modeling to analyze the relationships between a set of latent variables. Results: Our results confirm that mindfulness is negatively related to stress and this effect fully mediates the positive relationship between mindfulness and both sleep quality and well-being. Furthermore, our results show that if the effect of stress is taken into account, sleep quality does not mediate the influence of mindfulness on well-being and in fact does not relate to well-being at all. Conclusions: Our study points to the central role of stress reduction in explaining the beneficial effects of mindfulness on both behavioral and psychological variables. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Mediation; Mediation analysis; Mindfulness; SEM; Sleep; Stress; Structural equation modeling; Well-being,"Institute of cognitive sciences and technologies, CNR, Rome, Italy; Department of Psychology, “Sapienza,” University of Rome, Rome, Italy; School of Buddhist Studies, Philosophy and Comparative Religions, Nalanda University, Rajgir, India",English

"Bhattacharjee D., Mandal S., Shit P., Varghese M.G., Vishnoi A., Bhadra A.",Free-Ranging Dogs Are Capable of Utilizing Complex Human Pointing Cues,2020,Frontiers in Psychology,"Dogs are one of the most common species to be found as pets and have been subjects of human curiosity, leading to extensive research on their socialization with humans. One of the dominant themes in dog cognition pertains to their capacity for understanding and responding to human referential gestures. The remarkable sociocognitive skills of pet dogs, while interacting with humans, is quite well established. However, studies regarding the free-ranging subpopulations are greatly lacking. The interactions of these dogs with humans are quite complex and multidimensional. For the first time, we tested 160 adult free-ranging dogs to understand their ability to follow relatively complex human referential gestures using dynamic and momentary distal pointing cues. We found that these dogs are capable of following distal pointing cues from humans to locate hidden food rewards. However, approximately half of the population tested showed a lack of tendency to participate even after successful familiarization with the experimental setup. A closer inspection revealed that anxious behavioral states of the individuals were responsible for such an outcome. Finally, we compared the results using data from an earlier study with dynamic proximal cues. We found that free-ranging dogs follow distal cues more accurately compared to proximal cue. We assume that life experiences with humans probably shape personalities of free-ranging dogs, which in turn influence their responsiveness to human communicative gestures. © Copyright © 2020 Bhattacharjee, Mandal, Shit, Varghese, Vishnoi and Bhadra.",distal cues; interspecific communication; point following; referential gestures; social cognition,"Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Kolkata, India; Department of Environmental Science, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India; Department of Zoology, CMS College Kottayam, Kottayam, India; Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, Bhopal, India",English
"Kuriakose V., S S., Jose H., Jose S.",Testing activity reduces conflict associated strain (ARCAS) model: A test of moderated mediation model of relationship conflict and employee well-being,2020,Personnel Review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to test the activity reduces conflict associated strain (ARCAS) model with the aid of AET examining the direct effect of relationship conflict on employee well-being and also discussing the mechanism through which relationship conflict influences employee well-being, and also to test the ARCAS model examining whether passive and active conflict management styles influence this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Responses were collected from 554 software engineers using structured questionnaire and postulated relationships were tested using Process Macros. Findings: The study established that relationship conflicts are detrimental to employee well-being. It also established the indirect effect of relationship conflict on employee well-being through negative affect state. Negative affect state is an intra-personal mechanism linking relationship conflict and employee well-being. The study also extended the ARCAS model by establishing that passive ways of handling conflict amplify and problem-solving conflict management style mitigates the adverse impact of relationship conflict. Contrary to the prediction, forcing conflict management style was found to amplify the adverse effect of relationship conflict on well-being through negative affect state. Practical implications: The findings of the study highlight the detrimental effect of relationship conflict on well-being and highlight the vital role of individual affective states in the conflict process.

"Kumar S., Saini R., Jain R.",Hand preference and intolerance of uncertainty: Atypical cerebral lateralization advantages lower intolerance of uncertainty,2020,Laterality,"Left and inconsistent hand preferences are the markers of atypical brain organization that relate with cognitive and behavioural traits as well as with developmental disorders, whereas intolerance of uncertainty is the trait of inability to bear future uncertainty that mediates anxiety disorders and depression. In the present study, relationship of hand preference with intolerance of uncertainty was studied in a sample of 862 college students (age: M = 21.4 years, SD = 3.12). Results show that left-handers had lower prospective intolerance of uncertainty than right-handers. Furthermore, inconsistent right-handers had lower inhibitive intolerance of uncertainty than consistent right-handers. Thus, the present study supports the likelihood that atypical brain organization advantages tolerance of uncertainty (i.e., lower intolerance of uncertainty). Implications of these findings for understanding the contribution of intolerance of uncertainty to anxiety have been discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Anxiety; laterality; prefrontal cortex; sex hormone; uncertainty,"Department of Psychology, D.A.V.

"Kausik N.H., Hussain D.",Integrating Nurtured Heart Approach with Self-Determination Theory: A Proposed Intervention Model for Managing Disruptive Behaviors of Children,2020,Child Care in Practice,"This paper presents a conceptual framework to understand the Nurtured Heart Approach (NHA) through the perspective of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The Nurtured Heart Approach and the Self-Determination Theory are discussed and the parallels are drawn between the two, to provide a theoretical foundation to NHA and support for its effectiveness, which is otherwise lacking. The NHA, developed to help parents manage the undesirable behaviors of children, does not have a foundation of any particular theory. The approach is backed by anecdotal reports rather than empirical findings. Self-Determination Theory is a broad theory of motivation that proposes that human beings have three basic psychological needs-the need for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. The main techniques of NHA fit well with the elements which support the satisfaction of these basic psychological needs. The paper provides a theoretical framework to NHA by highlighting how it brings about sustainable behavioral change and self-regulation by fulfilling the satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs as proposed by SDT. © 2018, © 2018 The Child Care in Practice Group.",Nurtured heart approach; psychological needs; self-determination theory; undesirable behavior,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, Assam, India",English

To understand the world of adolescents and their mental health and well-being, it would be important to be able to access their experiences. Therefore, an objective measure to assess experiences is necessary. The study aimed to develop a scale to assess experiences and establish their psychometric properties. Materials and methods: My Experiences Scale (MES) is a newly developed 50-item, multiple-choice, self-report measure. Various steps involved in developing the MES and establishing its psychometric properties have been elaborated. The study was carried out across four phases, and the sample consisted of 1,260 school-going children and adolescents. The participants were representative of both genders, a wide age range, and diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Results: MES was found to have good internal consistency (Alpha 0.85) and test–retest reliability (0.96). MES was found to have significant correlations with Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and global self-worth. Conclusions: The newly developed experiences scale shows promising psychometric properties and a wide scope for application. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Experiences in children and adolescents; experiences scale; steps in scale construction,"Dept of Clinical Psychology, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept of Biostatistics, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Dept of Psychiatric Social Work, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

However, the Hindi adaptation of this scale with evident psychometric properties is not available. This study aimed to adapt the ASS in the Hindi language and, further, to validate it in the Indian setting. Methods: Translation and back-translation methods were used to translate the original items of the ASS to the Hindi language. After completion of translations and linguistic adaptation process, the Hindi translated version of the ASS, WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to 140 caregivers of persons with mental illness. Purposive sampling method was adopted. The age range of the participants was 17–60 years. Psychometric properties, as well as the factor structures of the scale, were evaluated. Results: The Hindi version of the ASS has adequate internal consistencies (r = 0.87–0.93) and test–retest reliability (r = 0.78, P < 0.001). The concurrent validity of this scale was also high, as the correlation coefficients among the Hindi version of the ASS, WHOQOL-BREF, GHQ-12, and HADS were ranging from 0.23 to 0.35. The exploratory factor analysis revealed three underlying factors, namely, cognition, affect, and behavior. Conclusions: The Hindi version of the ASS is a reliable and valid psychometric tool to measure affiliate stigma in caregivers of patients with mental illness. © 2020 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Affiliate Stigma Scale; Factor structure; Hindi adaptation; Mental illness,"Dept of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",English
"Li X., Zhou P., Wu J., Shanthini A., Vadivel T.",Research on artificial intelligence learning system based on psychological knowledge to adjust anxiety and depression,2020,Behaviour and Information Technology,"As a countermeasure to an increasing occurrence of mental illness worldwide, monitoring mental health has received significant attention. The application of artificial intelligence to mental health has immense potential to personalise treatment selection, monitoring, reoccurrence prediction, diagnosis, and prevention of disorders of mental well-being before they are symptomatic at clinical levels and even treating them. Therefore, in this paper, a Deep learning-based integrated psychological activity monitoring system (DLIPAMS) has been proposed to predict the anxiety and depression of humans. For a prediction of mental illness, the nature of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence can be fully exploited. When implemented in real-time, these systems can support society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with immoral behaviour. The data has been pre-processed using the correlation-based filtering approach, and the essential features have been selected. The responses to the questionnaire derived from the target group were first exposed to deep learning strategies. By calculating the dice coefficient ratio, the labels obtained as a result of the classification, and it has been validated. These cluster labels were used to create classifications to predict an individual's mental health. The target groups were populations from various groups such as high school graduates, university students, and job professionals. The work analyzes how the above deep learning methods are adapted to the target groups and suggests guidelines for future practices. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anxiety; artificial intelligence; Deep learning; depression; psychology knowledge,"Business School of Hohai University, Nanjing, China; School of Law Politics and Public Management, Huaiyin Normal University, Huaian, China; School of Economics and Management, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China; School of Economics, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China; Department of Information Technology, SRM University, Chennai, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Veltech University, Chennai, India",English
"Tasneem S.A., Panwar N.",Emotion Regulation and Psychological Well-being as Contributors Towards Mindfulness Among Under-Graduate Students,2020,Human Arenas,"Emotion regulation is generally described as the ability of an individual not only to manage emotions effectively but also to respond effectively to the emotional experience. It has also been viewed as a crucial aspect for psychological well-being. It is a psychological state which means more than just being free from stress and not having any other psychological disorder reported by the individual. At the same time, students with higher emotion regulation and psychological well-being are expected to be more attentive and able to observe, describe and participate in the present moment, effectively, with non-judgmental awareness, which is in turn defined as mindfulness. Hence, it has been expected that participants with higher emotion regulation and psychological well-being would also report higher levels of mindfulness. Therefore, the present empirical investigation has been conducted with an objective of assessing the level of emotion regulation, psychological well-being and mindfulness among under-graduate students. Additionally, it was also expected that all the said variables would be positively correlated and emotion regulation and psychological well-being would predict mindfulness positively for under-graduate students. For this purpose, ex post facto research design was adopted, and standardized tools pertaining to emotion regulation, psychological well-being and mindfulness were administered on a sample of 104 under-graduate students. The results of correlation statistics revealed that emotional regulation (r = 0.27; p < 0.01) and psychological well-being (r = 0.21; p < 0.01) are the positive and significant correlates of mindfulness. Additionally, statistical outcomes of stepwise multiple regression analysis confirm that emotion regulation and psychological well-being are the significant predictors of mindfulness and contribute collectively towards a 11% variance towards the same. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Emotion regulation; Mental health; Mindfulness; Psychological well-being,"P.G.

"Ajmani N., Kumar S.",The Struggles of Self: Analysing the Music of Linkin Park and Sleeping At Last,2020,Human Arenas,"The notion of self has been a subject of extensive research in both Western as well as Indian contexts. However, there is a dearth of contemporary self-reported accounts on self in the existing literature. The present study, therefore, seeks to counter this issue by exploring various conceptions of self and its struggles as represented in pop culture, specifically music. Music has been singled out owing to its cathartic nature for both the performers and the listeners. Moreover, it was also chosen as research suggests that millennials spend a lot of their time listening to music, thereby echoing their emotional lives as well. Therefore, the lyrics of the songs were analysed to provide an account of the self as experienced in modern lives. For the purpose of the study, 5 songs by the American rock band Linkin Park and 3 songs by an independent artist Sleeping At Last were selected because of the similarity in their content with respect to the portrayal of struggles faced by self and were analysed using thematic analysis. The results unveiled themes like “Dearth of Self”, “Oppression of the Self” and “Self-Sabotaging Thoughts”, among others, which highlight the existential nature of the conflicts that the self undergoes. It can be inferred that self-deprecating nature of one’s own thoughts and a perceived sense of external pressure on the self lay the foundation of the struggles of the self. This study has implications for unravelling these struggles and using that knowledge to possibly deal with it. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Music; Overwhelming control; Self; Self-deprecation; Struggles of self,"Department of Psychology, Indraprastha College for Women, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India",English
"Sahu D.R., Chowdhury B., Sahoo B.M.",Anti-convulsant action and attenuation of oxidative stress by Citrus limon peel extracts in PTZ and MES induced convulsion in albino rats,2020,Central Nervous System Agents in Medicinal Chemistry,"Background: Citrus limon a small evergreen plant belongs to the family Rutaceae. Th-ese species are extensively cultivated throughout the world because of their multiple health benefits for humans and their applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Various studies were conducted using their plant parts (fruits, flowers, peels, leaves, blossoms) but the studies on peel extracts are very limited. However, the anticonvulsant activity of peels has not been studied yet. Objective: The main goal of this study is to appraise the anticonvulsant effect stimulated by the an-tioxidant property of hydroalcoholic extracts of Citrus limon (HAECL) peels in various animal models. Methods: The anticonvulsant and in vivo antioxidant activity of HAECL peels was observed by Maximal electric shock (MES) model, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced clonic convulsion model and PTZ induced kindling test. The extract was administered to test groups at doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg. orally in PTZ and MES methods. The highest dose of extract was given to the test grouped animals in case of a kindling test. After completion of the time period of kindling, the brains of all grouped animals were isolated and subjected to analyse oxidative stress parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) biochemically to investigate the antioxidant profile of the plant. Results: HAECL peels at doses of 400 and 600 mg/kg significantly (p<0.01) delayed the onset, decreased the duration of myoclonic spasm in PTZ induced seizure model and also significantly (p<0.01) decreased the duration of hind limb tonic extension (HLTE) as well as significantly (p<0.05) increased the postictal depression (PID) in MES model compared to control. In the PTZ-induced kindling model, the malondialdehyde (MDA) level was elevated with a diminished level of SOD, CAT, GSH compared to the control group but pretreatment with HAECL at the highest dose reduced the MDA level and refined SOD, CAT and GSH status effectively. Conclusion: From the above investigation, it was concluded that HAECL could produce significant anticonvulsant activity and also attenuate oxidative stress-induced during a seizure. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.",Albino rats; Citrus limon peels; Convulsion; Hydroalcoholic extracts; Pentylenetetrazole; Postictal depression,"Department of Pharmacology, Roland Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Khodasingi, Berhampur, Odisha, 760010, India",English

We examined how religious beliefs relate to distress and psychological well-being in a sample of Hindu students in India. 178 students (36% women, 64% men, mean age of 22.7 years) completed questionnaires regarding religious beliefs, distress (depression, anxiety, stress) and positive well-being (happiness, life satisfaction, meaning in life). Religious beliefs were unrelated to frequency of service attendance, importance of prayer, or influence of religion on one's life and related positively to depression and anxiety as well as meaning in life. Associations of religious beliefs and wellbeing were modest and did not strongly support general theoretical notions that religious beliefs are a source of comfort.

Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the generality versus specificity of dissociation as a symptom concurrently, as well as its ability to predict increases in psychopathology after 9.5 months, above and beyond neuroticism. In bivariate analyses, all 3 dissociation facets related broadly evidence that dissociation is transdiagnostic in nature. Memory Disturbances maintained this breadth when controlling for neuroticism, as did Depersonalization/ Derealization to a lesser degree. This pattern was replicated across methods with diagnostic interviews, although with slightly less breadth. In predicting changes in psychopathology after a span of 9.5 months, Depersonalization/Derealization and Memory Disturbances displayed an impressive breadth across symptoms, whereas Fantasy predicted increases in mania in particular. When these analyses controlled for neuroticism, Depersonalization/Derealization maintained strong predictive power, especially relation to internalizing psychopathology. Based on these findings, we argue that dissociation is a transdiagnostic symptom of psychopathology and may even be a risk factor across all forms of psychopathology. Ultimately, this symptom domain merits greater attention in both research and clinical work given its generalized presence throughout psychopathology. © 2020.

Patra U.,Queer Camera: Christopher Isherwood’s Goodbye to Berlin and Prater Violet,2020,Journal of Homosexuality,"This essay locates Christopher Isherwood’s radical energy in the use of emergent visual technologies to curate a space for queer desire in his works Goodbye to Berlin (1939) and Prater Violet (1945). Isherwood subverts the heteronormative cinematic discourses by pausing them and preparing Instantaneous Photographs out of small moments that engage in a play of stillness and movement. The pauses enable the narratives to constantly draw attention toward themselves as well as the namesake narrators who voice their queer desire in those moments. This presents to us the unique esthetics of Isherwood wherein the visual does not only serve the novelistic in being a narrative strategy but becomes an epistemological mode through which the visual constructs queer subjectivity, in a world witnessing the rise of fascist forces. In short, the “queer camera,” seizing the grand narrative of history, forges queer time and queer voice, and, thereby, an alternative history that acknowledges queer presence. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",alternative history; Christopher Isherwood; cinema; Instantaneous Photograph; queer esthetics; queer time; visual modernism,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India",English
"Gupta K., Agrawal J.",Lay Meanings and Associated Experiences of Nonattachment (Anasakti): A Study From India,2020,Journal of Humanistic Psychology,"Anasakti, translated as “nonattachment” in English, is one of the important philosophical concepts of Hinduism and Buddhism. It has also been studied in contemporary psychology using various measures of anasakti. However, there is a dearth of studies that have qualitatively investigated anasakti from the lay or “folk” perspective. This mixed-method study aimed to uncover subjective meanings and personal belief systems related to anasakti, as well as practices and experiences related to the lay understanding of anasakti among a sample of 240 urban educated adults (female = 104, male = 136) in India. Three structured scales (Test of asakti–anasakti, Scale of anasakti, Nonattachment Scale) were used to assess the levels of anasakti, while a semistructured questionnaire elicited personal meanings, experiences, and associated behaviors and beliefs related to anasakti. Thematic analysis revealed five broad thematic categories covering the qualitative data: personal meanings of anasakti, experiences, benefits, efficacy, and pathways. Roles of desire and attachment were also discussed. Quantitative results indicated higher levels of anasakti in older age groups, suggesting that anasakti may progress with age.

"Verma Y., Tiwari G.K., Pandey A., Pandey R.",Triguna (three qualities) personality model and two-factor conceptualization of self-compassion: A new insight to understand achievement goal orientations,2020,Current Issues in Personality Psychology,"Background Although the three-dimensional Vedic personality model (Triguna) and self-compassion have been linked with a variety of life outcomes, little is known about their interplay in shaping goal orientations. We explored the interrelationships and interplay of the Triguna (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) with positive and negative self-compassion in shaping the goal orientations of Indian students. participants and procedure Using convenience sampling, 190 males (M = 20.13, SD = 2.21) and 187 females (M = 19.88, SD = 1.81) were assessed on self-report measures. Data were analysed using correlational statistics, factor analysis and path analysis. results Factor analyses supported our speculation that the Self-Compassion Scale is best represented by a two-factor model (positive and negative). Positive self-compassion and Sattva Guna showed positive correlations with mastery and performance goals while negative self-compassion showed an opposite pattern. Rajas and Tamas Gunas were negatively correlated with mastery and positively with performance goals. Gender, Sattva Guna and positive self-compassion accounted for significant variance in mastery while gender, Sattva and Rajas Gunas and negative self-compassion contributed to performance-approach. Sattva Guna and self-compassion (positive and negative) contributed significantly to performance-avoidance. Path analysis revealed direct as well as indirect effects of the three Gunas on the goal orientations through positive and negative self-compassion. conclusions The Triguna personality and two-factor conceptualization of self-compassion evinced their relevance in understanding the goal orientations of Indian students. Re-conceptualization of the Self-Compassion Scale and its interplay with Triguna personality dimensions in shaping the goal orientations of students need further verification in diverse and cross-cultural populations. © 2020 Current Issues in Personality Psychology.

"Karmakar A., Bhattacharya M., Adhya J., Chatterjee S., Dogra A.K.",The trend of association between autism traits in mothers and severity of autism symptomatology in children,2020,Advances in Autism,"Purpose: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous disorders, and heterogeneity lies both at genetic and phenotypic levels. To better understand the etiology and pathway that may contribute to autism symptomatology, it is important to study milder expressions of autism characteristics – autistic traits or milder expressions of autism phenotype, especially in intergenerational context. This study aims to see the trend of association, if any, between child autism symptom and mothers’ autism phenotype as well as mothers’ theory of mind and to see if mothers’ theory of mind was associated with their own autistic traits. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 96 mothers of children with varying symptom severity of autism (mild, moderate and severe) using Autism Spectrum Quotient and faux pas recognition test. Analysis of variance, trend analysis and t-test were done. Findings: Results showed a linear trend of relationship between mothers’ autism phenotype and child symptom severity. However, the groups did not have significant differences in theory of mind. Only a few components of theory of mind were found to be associated with autistic traits. These findings question the prevailing idea that theory of mind can be a reliable endophenotype of autism. Research limitations/implications: There has been a lack of research assessing the possible link between parents’ autism phenotype and symptom severity of ASD children. This study is a preliminary step towards that direction. This study indicates a probability of shared genetic liability between mothers and offspring, which would have important consequences for understanding the mechanisms that lead to autism. Practical implications: This study offers implications for treatment planning of those with clinical ASD. An awareness of parental factors is critical for any holistic intervention plan when a family seeks treatment for their child. This study suggests that while individualising interventions, clinicians may consider possible presence of high levels of autistic traits and related cognitive features present in the probands’ parents. Originality/value: There has been lack of research assessing the possible link between parents’ autism phenotype and symptom severity of ASD children. This study, even though preliminary, is a step towards that direction. This study suggests that autism traits might be influenced by common genetic variation and indicates a probability of shared genetic liability between mothers and offspring, which would have important consequences for understanding the mechanisms that lead to autism. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autism spectrum disorders; Autistic traits; Theory of mind,"Department of Psychology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India; Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Crystal Minds, Kolkata, India; Department of Social Sciences, Maharaja Manindra Chandra College, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India",English

These studies indicate that in the abstract mindset people have more self-control than in the concrete mindset. Though some studies have been carried out on behavioral control as well, however, the influence of mindsets on eye movement control has not been explored. Aiming to explore this relationship, two experiments were conducted on university students using an eye-tracker.

To test eye movement control, experiment 1 used an anti-saccade task, in which the participants were asked to look away from the target, while experiment 2 used a visual search task where participants were asked to make goal-directed eye movements and avoid any distraction. The results of both the experiments showed that participants tended to have more control over their eye movement during the abstract mindset than the concrete mindset. This shows that mindsets not only help in controlling thoughts and general behaviors but also influence eye movements and govern what to look and where to look.

The proposed model was empirically tested using longitudinal research design. The primary data was gathered at three time points through a survey of 197 students at an Indian university. Stepwise regression analysis was used to test the hypothesised relationships in the proposed model. The results demonstrate that technological characteristics, user characteristics and MOOCs features influence the students’ decisions in all the stages of MOOCs acceptance including initial adoption, completion and continuance. Environmental factors determine the students’ initial intentions to adopt MOOCs, whereas MOOCs qualities predict their intentions to complete and continue the usage of MOOCs in future. Moreover, the intention to adopt MOOCs significantly predicts the intention to complete MOOCs which in turn significantly determines the intention to continue using MOOCs. These findings will be helpful for MOOCs providers and other stakeholders.

"Saha S., Basu S., Pandit D.","Identifying Factors Influencing Perceived Quality of Life (QoL) of Indian Elderly: Case Study of Kolkata, India",2020,Social Indicators Research,"Well-being of the Indian elderly is presently a concern in the urban Indian society due to the gradual decline in the capacity of the family to serve as care-givers for their elderly members. Holistic improvement in the lives of the Indian elderly requires an understanding of the varied aspects which they perceive to influence their lives. The concept of perceived Quality of life (QoL) deals with an individual’s assessment of varied aspects influencing their well-being. Considering the role of social and economic backgrounds on the perception of QoL, this paper identifies the factors which the Indian elderly from varied backgrounds associate with their perceived QoL. Using interviews with 83 elderly residents of Kolkata, India, this paper identifies 58 factors for eight broad domains, which influence the perceived QoL of Indian elderly. The findings from the present research will help in the formulation of an index for measuring QoL, which can subsequently facilitate the preparation of policy guidelines for the improvement of QoL of elderly, especially the QoL of Indian elderly. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Elderly; Indian elderly; Perceived QoL; Quality of life,"Department of Planning and Architecture, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India; Department of Architecture and Regional Planning, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India",English

The purpose of this study was to investigate if insomnia and insomnia-related sleep complaints are associated with anxiety, age, and sleep hygiene practices among a sample of university students in Ethiopia. Design, Measures, Setting, and Participants: The participants were young adults (n=525; mean age 21.5 ± 3.0 years; mean BMI of 20.7 ± 2.7kg/m2). Young collegiate adults at Mizan-Tepi University in southwestern Ethiopia were randomly selected to participate in this cross-sectional study. The measures included the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire-Mizan (LSEQ-M), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 Scale (GAD-7), and the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI). Descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression, and multiple linear regressions were used. Results: Insomnia was associated with young age group (≤25 years) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–4.66), higher GAD-7 (anxiety) (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.0–1.10) and SHI (poor sleep hygiene) (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.05–1.26) scores. All four insomnia-related sleep complaints were associated with increasing GAD-7 scores, as well as higher SHI scores (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Insomnia was associated with younger age group (≤25 years), higher anxiety level, and poor sleep hygiene. Four major sleep complaints in insomnia, ie, sleep onset problems, poor sleep quality, awakening problems, and daytime disturbances, were all associated with higher anxiety levels and poor sleep hygiene. © 2020 Manzar et al.",Daytime dysfunction; Low-income country; Sleep; Sleepiness; Young adults,"Department of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Saudi Arabia; Centre for Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Sciences, Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi, India; Mizan-Tepi University, Mizan-Aman, Ethiopia; Department of Bio-Molecular Sciences, Pharmacology Division, University of Mississippi, Oxford, MS, United States; Independent Researcher, Toronto, ON, Canada; Somnogen Canada Inc, Toronto, ON, Canada; The University Sleep Disorders Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; The Strategic Technologies Program of the National Plan for Sciences and Technology, Innovation in Saudi Arabia (MED511-02-08), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",English

A novel method, PETTLEP imagery combines both conventional and non-conventional style of training of an athlete and improves one's performance. This study aimed to analyze the tennis service performance of junior tennis players based on PETTLEP imagery training. Forty-four junior male tennis players (M age=13.22 years, SD=0.42) were selected for the study. The investigator handed over the MIQ-R questionnaire to all the participants in which they scored 16 and above points as per previous research. The participants were equally divided (n=11) into three experimental groups (E1, E2, and E3) and a control group. The service performance outcomes of all the players were compared before and after a training session. The three experimental groups were assigned with service-specific training, service-specific training combined with PETTLEP imagery training, and PETTLEP imagery training alone, respectively, for three days per week for 12 weeks. They were tested on their service accuracy based on the International tennis number (ITN) manual on-court assessment test. The data were assessed for normality and analyzed using non-parametric methods to reveal main effects (each training method alone) as well as to calculate the combined effect of PETTLEP and service-specific training. Certain significant improvements in tennis service were observed with service-specific training alone. Though it marginally outperformed the PETTLEP imagery method, the most improved services were observed with both PETTLEP and service-specific training utilized together. This implies an additive effect when both methods are used together. © 2020 Nafih Cherappurath, published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2020.",", novice tennis players; PETTLEP imagery, tennis service, international tennis number (ITN)","Department of Physical Education and Sports, Pondicherry University, Pondicherry, India; Department of Applied Psychology, Pondicherry University, Pondicherry, India; Department of Behavioural and Social Sciences, European University, Nicosia, Cyprus; Brain Science and Analytics, Stremble Venture Ltd, Nicosia, Cyprus",English

In a single time-point randomized controlled intervention, participants in India (N = 431), Taiwan (N = 112), and the U.S. (N = 307) were randomly assigned either to write a gratitude letter to someone who had done a kind act for them, to write a gratitude letter to themselves for a kind act they had done for another person, or to complete a neutral control writing activity. Immediately after completing their assigned writing activity, participants completed measures of state gratitude, elevation, and emotions (guilt, indebtedness, embarrassment, positive affect, and negative affect). U.S. (but not Indian and Taiwanese) participants who expressed gratitude reported greater state gratitude relative to controls. Although not explicitly grateful, however, Indian and Taiwanese participants who wrote gratitude letters reported higher elevation (and Indian participants, reduced negative affect) compared to control participants. Finally, compared to control participants, Taiwanese (but not U.S.) participants felt less guilty when writing a gratitude letter to themselves.

Twitter is the most prioritized social network concerning the issues of children with special needs related topics of social users. Extracting good quality of topics from twitter corpus depends on the quality of text pre-processing and in finding optimal cluster tendency. With traditional topic models, cluster tendency identification is difficult because they use less frequent words in tweets. In traditional topic models, k value (number of clusters) decided manually and used Euclidean distance metric in most methods and cosine distance metrics in some methods. Proper Visualization of cluster tendency is also essential as corpus consists of a large number of documents and billions of words. In this paper, hybrid topic models with multi-viewpoints based similarity metric proposed to Visualize topic clouds, to find cluster tendency of various topics related to issues of children with special needs twitter datasets. Experimental evaluation and comparison of these proposed hybrid models done with other distance metrics. Empirical analysis performed with convergence speed and computational complexities.

Two hundred fourteen participants (18 to 30 years) comprising 100 males (Mean Age = 22.15(1.61)) and 114 females (Mean Age = 22.00(1.95)) were chosen for the study. Self-forgiveness (Mudgal & Tiwari, 2017a) and Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (Keyes, 2005) were used as the tools. Self-forgiveness comprises Realization & Reparation, Guilt, Attribution and overall self-forgiveness (sum of the first three) while Human Flourishing consists of Hedonic and Eudaimonic (Social plus Psychological) Well-Being. The aggregate of Hedonic and Eudaimonic is overall Human Flourishing. The findings suggested no gender differences in Self-Forgiveness of the participants. Conversely, gender differences were observed in all the dimensions of Human Flourishing in favour of males. Irrespective of gender, Realization & Reparation was positively correlated with Hedonic, Social, Psychological and Eudaimonic Well-Being as well as Human Flourishing except for Guilt and Attribution that showed small positive or negative correlations. Irrespective of gender, Overall Self-Forgiveness correlated positively with all the dimensions of Flourishing. Gender and Realization & Reparation emerged as the significant predictors accounting for significant variance in all the dimensions of Flourishing while Guilt and Attribution did not. The findings suggested that remorse, easy acceptance of wrongdoing, repairing the relationship with self and others, ability to minimize negative emotions towards self, monitoring others’ positive behaviours and acknowledgements of valued and close relationships were the psychological mechanisms that may underlie the predictive strengths of self-forgiveness in regulating flourishing. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Measurement invariance of the two-factor IIECQ model (interpersonal and intrapersonal emotional competence factors) was examined across countries and gender groups using a sample of 998 students from five different countries (Slovenia, Russia, Croatia, India, and the Czech Republic). Our results supported partial scalar invariance of the IIECQ across countries with three items having varying intercepts in different countries. Scalar invariance was fully confirmed across gender groups. Latent means for the two IIECQ factors were compared between the five countries and the two gender groups. While men and women reported similar levels of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotional competences, significant differences were observed between some of the countries. To assess the construct validity of the IIECQ, correlations were examined between the IIECQ subscale scores and the measures of emotion regulation, personality, and well-being. In general, correlations were low to moderate and in accordance with expectations, showing adequate convergent validity of the new scales.

Alzheimer's disease is a non-primary tauopathy, which displays tau neuropathology of excess tangle formation and accumulation. FTDP-17 mutations are responsible for early onset of AD, which can be attributed to compromised physiological functions due to the mutations. Tau is a microtubule-binding protein that secures the integrity of polymerized microtubules in neuronal cells. It malfunctions owing to various insults and stress conditions-like mutations and post-translational modifications. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we modified the wild type and tau mutants by methyl glyoxal and thus studied whether glycation can enhance the aggregation of predisposed mutant tau. METHODS: Tau glycation was studied by fluorescence assays, SDS-PAGE analysis, conformational evaluation, and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Our study suggests that FTDP-17 mutant P301 L leads to enhanced glycation-induced aggregation as well as advanced glycation end products formation. Glycation forms amorphous aggregates of tau and its mutants without altering its native conformation. CONCLUSION: The metabolic anomalies and genetic predisposition have found to accelerate tau-mediated neurodegeneration and prove detrimental for the early-onset of Alzheimer's disease.",Advanced glycation end products; Alzheimer’s disease; FTDP-17; tau glycation,"Neurobiology Group, Biochemical Sciences Division, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India",English

Pandit G.L.,Freudian Frontiers of Psychoanalytic Theory and Therapy: A Case of Improvement of Scientific Knowledge?,2020,Journal of Constructivist Psychology,"As a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and the psychoanalyst, the methodological challenges of psychoanalysis are many. The paper draws on author’s earlier work focusing on the (i) scientific construal of the clinical claims psychoanalysis makes and (ii) its philosophical-hermeneutic construal that extends to metapsychology. The former involves mainly a therapy premised on the empirically testable causal hypotheses, while the latter involves claims to meaning connections. As a “theory of human nature and therapy,” the claims of psychoanalytic inquiry are subjected to a thought-experimental-test-design patterned after what I call the paradox of the lost original text. The linguistic analog of the lost original text having any number of surviving translations in any number of languages is relevant in the context of psychoanalytic interpretation of dreams, especially to “recovering” the latent contents of a dream from its manifest contents. The thought-experimental-test-design sets limit to the possibilities of exploring the unconscious mind without rendering Freud’s methodology irrelevant or useless. The paper then briefly rethinks the frontier(s) of psychoanalytic inquiry, viewed as a branch of clinical psychology, for its relevance to the contemporary issues of individual psychical well-being. Premised on the methodological imperative of opening these frontiers to a deeper investigation than has been possible over the past hundred years, the challenging task of probing the frontiers of research opened by psychoanalytic inquiry in the world of individual psychical life, well-being and suffering is shown to extend to far deeper worlds in the ecology of consciousness, demanding carefully crafted methodological variance. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",explanations of action by explanatory reasons (ER explanations);; explanations of action by relevant causal explanations (RC explanations);; methodological variance; motivational explanations;; Unknown knowables in science;,"Department of Philosophy, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India",English

Diaschisis, the network concept of cognitive functions, and interindividual variability are among the plausible explanations cited in the literature for such unusual clinical cases. We describe here the case of a nonfluent type of aphasia following an ischemic stroke predominantly affecting the left posterior perisylvian cortex in a right-handed Bengali-speaking woman. The patient's comprehension was well preserved; however, she presented with a severe motor speech defect. MRI revealed an ischemic lesion in the left parietotemporal area, with slight involvement of the postero-inferior frontal cortex. We suggest two plausible explanations for this lesion-aphasia discordance: Our patient had bilateral representation of language receptive functions in her brain, and additional areas neighboring the classical Broca area may support some critical mechanisms of speech production. Taken together, these explanations may clarify why our patient was able to maintain the ability to decode language even though her language production was significantly affected. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Background: Anxiety and depression are often comorbid with neurological as well as other medical maladies. Clinically known anxiolytics (Benzodiazepines) are accompanied by untoward sedation and other CNS depressive actions. The quinazolinone moiety is a privileged pharmacophore with a wide pharmacological spectrum. Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and neuro-pharmacological evaluation of some 2-substituted quinazolinone derivatives are reported. Methods: The synthesized compounds were characterized using1H-NMR and TLC analysis. Behavioral analysis was performed using EPM (Elevated Plus Maze), OFT (Open Field Test), PIST (Pentobarbital Induced Sleep Test), FST (Forced Swim Test) and PCPA (p-chlorophenyl alanine) bioassay. To further justify the therapeutic claim, systemic and neurotoxicological analysis of the most potent members of the series was performed using OECD mandated protocols. The studies showed that the compounds had a wide therapeutic window with &gt;1000 mg/kg and &gt;500 mg/kg LD50 and NOAEL, respectively. Results: The compounds with an electronegative group in the quinazolinone nucleus (3f, 3e, 3d, and 3c) induced anxiolysis devoid of sedative adverse reaction. Besides, anti-depressant efficacy of 3f, 3e, 3d, and 3c observed in rodents was a result of a decrease in anxiety level. It was found that the neurotoxicology of the potent members (3f, 3e, 3d, and 3c) advocated their wide therapeutic window with &gt;1000 mg/kg LD50 and &gt;5000 mg/kg NOAEL. Conclusion: Our findings of behavioral bioassays revealed that inducing an electronegative group into the quinazolinone nucleus yielded the most potent members of the series (3f, 3e, 3d, and 3c). The said compounds were found to produce anxiolysis and anti-depressive action without sedative-hypnotic side effects in rodent models.

Based on the thematic data analysis network, it was found that clowning has instilled many values in the way they think. It has given them a platform to learn new things from the children they clown. Therefore, looking at these results it could be said that therapeutic clowning serves as a medium for community service and in maintaining personal wellbeing. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Clown’s psyche; Learning; Therapeutic clowning; Values; Wellbeing,"Department of Psychology, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Hosur Road, Bangalore, Karnataka  560029, India",English
Rousseva-Sokolova G.,Voices from the Past. Rearranging Values in Times of Crisis: The Example of North Indian Vaishnava Hagiographies,2020,Journal of Human Values,"This article is focussed on the study of a particular case of shift in religious values embodied in two seventeenth-century North Indian compilations of hagiographical narratives, elaborated within the religious community of Vallabhacharya, namely the collections of the 84 and 252 Vaishnava saints. The sect is presented against the backdrop of the mosaic-shaped Hindu landscape, where new ideas about sainthood and merit had come to challenge the established hierarchies and prevalent practices. The hagiographies, as a typical example of the ‘story with a message’ genre, bring down the lofty theological concepts, expounded in Sanskrit, to down-to-earth examples, voiced in everyday language, thus functioning as a practical guidance for followers of the sect. The article deconstructs the way narratives negotiate the establishing of a new religious value—bhakti—while addressing, at the same time, the devotees’ more traditional concerns, pertaining to the well-being of the forefathers, ritual purity or the concept of salvation, and promoting to them the lifestyle of economically engaged householders against the withdrawal of renouncement. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",bhakti; Caurāsī vaişņavan ki vārtā; Do sau bāvan vaişņavan ki vāatā; Gokulnath; Hagiography; Vallabhacharya,"O.P.

"Maiti D., Awasthi A.",ICT Exposure and the Level of Wellbeing and Progress: A Cross Country Analysis,2020,Social Indicators Research,"Innovations of information and communication technologies (ICTs) have influenced human life through time-saving, diffusion of knowledge, easy communication, and networks, access to information and automation with artificial intelligence. They not only increase productivity, cut-down hardship, improve transparency and governance, build social capital and empower individuals but also raise risks of cyber threats and insecurity of private life, displace labours, encourage sedentary life-style and digitally divide individuals in the society etc. These together do not seem to have unambiguous impacted on the aggregate wellbeing and progress (WPI) of a nation, and thus this paper empirically examined their resultant relationship at the aggregate level. An index of WPI has been prepared to account for the aggregate level of satisfaction derived from six sources, namely economic, human, progress, cultural, environmental wellbeing and happiness. Similarly, an index of ICT exposure has been constructed by combining access to mobile, internet and telephone connections, and internet security. Using a panel database for 67 countries representing all subcontinents during 2000–2014, we find that ICT exposure positively improves the aggregate level of WPI. The net impact is marginally lower in less-developed and developing countries (e.g., Africa, Asia, and the Middle East) than the rest (e.g., Europe and North America). © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Digital divide; ICT; Progress; Wellbeing,"Delhi School of Economics, Delhi University, North Campus, New Delhi, Delhi  110007, India; Jesus and Mary College, New Delhi, Delhi, India",English

"Richardson R., Nandi A., Jaswal S., Harper S.",The effect of intimate partner violence on women’s mental distress: a prospective cohort study of 3010 rural Indian women,2020,Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology,"Purpose: Intimate partner violence (IPV) encompasses physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, as well as controlling behavior. Most research focuses on physical and sexual abuse, and other aspects of IPV are rarely investigated. We estimated the effect of these neglected aspects of IPV on women’s mental distress. Methods: We used data from 3010 women living in rural tribal communities in Rajasthan, India. Women completed baseline interviews and were re-interviewed approximately 1.5 years later. We measured IPV with questions adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey’s Domestic Violence Module, which asked seven questions about physical abuse, three questions about psychological abuse, and five questions about partner controlling behavior. Mental distress was measured with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (score range 0–12). We used Poisson regression models to estimate the relation between changes in IPV and mental distress, accounting for time-fixed characteristics of individuals using individual fixed effects. Results: Women reported an average of 2.1 distress symptoms during baseline interviews. In models that controlled for time-varying confounding (e.g., wealth, other types of abuse), experiencing psychological abuse was associated with an increase of 0.65 distress symptoms (95% CI 0.32, 0.98), and experiencing controlling behavior was associated with an increase of 0.31 distress symptoms (95% CI 0.18, 0.44). However, experiencing physical abuse was not associated with an increase in distress symptoms (mean difference = − 0.15, 95% CI − 0.45, 0.15). Conclusions: Psychological abuse and controlling behavior may be important drivers of the relation between IPV and women’s mental health. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Controlling behavior; India; Intimate partner violence; Mental distress; Psychological abuse,"Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University, 722 West 168 th, New York, NY  10032, United States; Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Canada; Institute for Health and Social Policy, McGill University, Montreal, Canada; Centre for Health and Mental Health, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English
"Kim M., Song J., Nishi K., Sowndhararajan K., Kim S.",Changes in the Electroencephalographic Activity in Response to Odors Produced by Organic Compounds,2020,Journal of Psychophysiology,"Volatile organic compounds are widely used to manufacture various products in addition to research purposes. They play an important role in the air quality of outdoor and indoor with a pleasant or unpleasant odor. It is well known that the odor of chemicals with different structures can affect brain functions differently. In general, organic compounds are mainly characterized by their functional groups. Acetic acid, acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetonitrile are widely used laboratory chemicals with the same methyl group, but different functional groups. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate whether the exposure of these four chemicals (10%) exhibits the same electroencephalographic (EEG) activity or different. For this purpose, the EEG was recorded in 20 male healthy volunteers. The EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes located on the scalp, based on the International 10 20 system with modified combinatorial nomenclature. The results indicated that tested subjects are less sensitive to acetic acid odor than other three chemicals. The absolute theta activity significantly increased at Cp5 and F8 regions, and the relative mid-beta (RMB) significantly decreased at Fc1 region during the exposure of acetic acid. On the other hand, acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetonitrile produced EEG changes in many indices such as relative theta, relative gamma, relative high beta, relative beta, relative slow beta, the ratio of alpha to high beta, and spectral edge frequencies. However, there was no significant change in the absolute wave activity. Although acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetonitrile odors affected almost similar EEG indices, they exhibited changes in different brain regions. The variations in the EEG activity of these chemicals may be due to the activation of different olfactory receptors, odor characteristics, and structural arrangements. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",acetaldehyde; acetic acid; acetone; acetonitrile; electroencephalography; functional group,"School of Natural Resources and Environmental Science, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, 24341, South Korea; Department of Bioscience, Ehime University, Japan; Gangwon Perfume Alchemy Ltd.

There is scant literature available in Indian as well as Asian context. Methods: This study was conducted at Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi with an aim to assess the self-reported medication adherence and its correlates among a naturalistic, lithium-maintained cohort (n = 76) with bipolar disorder. Subjects were included if they were on lithium therapy ≥1 year, met DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were in clinical remission (≥1 month). Besides sociodemographic and clinical performa, participants were assessed on medication adherence rating scale (MARS), lithium questionnaire for knowledge and lithium attitude questionnaire (LAQ). Results: Mean age was 35.7 ± 10.6 years (males: 59.2%); median duration of illness and lithium therapy was 84 months and 24.5 months, respectively. Mean MARS score was 6.95 ± 2.81. Regression analysis (with MARS total as dependent variable) found LAQ score to be the single most significant predictor variable (β=−0.681, p < 0.0001), explaining over 75% of the total variance. In regression model with MARS factor-1 score as dependent variable, the 'LAQ score' (β=−0.601, p < 0.0001) and 'being accompanied by family during psychiatric visits (always/mostly) in the past year' (β = 0.193, p = 0.010) emerged as significant predictor variables. Conclusion: Adherence in lithium-maintained treatment-seeking cohort of patients with BD remains far from ideal as observed in this naturalistic setting. Lithium-related attitudes and being accompanied by family during psychiatric visits were found to be significant predictors for adherence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Adherence; Attitudes; Bipolar disorder; Family; India; Lithium,"Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029, India",English
Kumari A.,Elucidation of relationship between clothing silhouette and motifs with Indian Mughal architecture,2019,Fashion and Textiles,"Fashion adopts numerous creative ideas and the designers source them. Architecture is also not left out from the eye of designers. Fashion designers used to take their inspiration from architectural buildings normally to create new clothing silhouettes. But what is important to understand here is the nature of relationship between these two disciplines which made them to do so. Keeping this fact in mind, researcher tried to find the connection between ‘Fashion’ and ‘Architecture,’ which can serve as fashion element for designers. Clothing Silhouette and motif were the two criteria on which the relationship was investigated. Indian Mughal architectural monuments were selected, since Mughals were considered as the most influential rulers on Indian sub-continent, having unique heritage in terms of religion, arts, music and other ornamental techniques which are in vogue even in the modern era. The outcomes show that similar kind of motifs was used to ornament both textiles as well as walls of architectural monuments at same time frame. Clothing silhouettes of that time were also inspired from the outer shape of the monument. Further, while investigating, a functional aspect—one of the common causes of relationship in terms of comfort in both the disciplines was also found. © 2019, The Author(s).",Clothing comfort; Dome structure; Fashion and architecture; Floral motifs; Mughal costumes; Mughal monuments; Silhouettes,"Assistant Professor, Amity School of Fashion Design & Technology, Amity University Madhya Pradesh, Maharajpura Dang, Gwalior, MP  474005, India",English

As RGB cameras responds easily to illumination changes and surrounding clutters, the worthwhile RGB Depth (RGB-D) camera sensors (e.g. Kinect) is used to improve the action recognition. This paper aims at classifying Human Actions by integrating salient motion features from both RGB and Depth Camera. The methodology includes Salient Information Map generation from both RGB and depth action sequences signposting the motion significant region of the corresponding action sequence. From the Salient Information Map, Sign, Magnitude and Center descriptors representing Complete Local Binary Pattern was extracted. Then the fusion of features from depth and RGB is carried out by Canonical Correlation Analysis accompanied by dimensionality reduction. Multiclass SVM classifier is used for classifying the features in to various action categories.

"Mallick A.K., Mishra A.K.",Interest rates forecasting and stress testing in India: a PCA-ARIMA approach,2019,Palgrave Communications,"In the Basel III era, measuring, managing, mitigating and forecasting interest rate risk has become significant. In the first study of its kind, this paper develops a principal component analysis-based forecasting of interest rates of different maturities and stress testing approach in a univariate auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) framework in the context of India. Debating the existence of multiple representations of interest rates in the Indian market, the study broke down all the short-term, as well as long-term interest rates to derive the optimal principal component of unique interest rates. These unique interest rates are further exercised to forecast the future interest rates through the ARIMA model. The rolling average method was applied to the recently created Indian volatility index (VIX) to place the stress points. The model performance was examined over this stress point of building multiple scenario analysis. The study found that ARIMA (2-1-1) forecasting model of interest rates produced a better forecast result, both in the case of in-sample and out-of-sample performances as well as in stress periods. From the forecasting results, the study found that the proportionate gain in yield is higher as the maturity increases. By examining the stress period on the basis of eight quarters (2007: Q4 of 2009: Q3) rolling average on Indian volatility Indices, the survey concluded that the Indian economy will reach a stable situation signalled by less volatile interest rates post the second quarter of 2018. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"School of Economics, University of Hyderabad, Prof. C.R.

Surveying the Conditions for Free Will Across Cultures,2019,Frontiers in Psychology,"Philosophers have long debated whether, if determinism is true, we should hold people morally responsible for their actions since in a deterministic universe, people are arguably not the ultimate source of their actions nor could they have done otherwise if initial conditions and the laws of nature are held fixed. To reveal how non-philosophers ordinarily reason about the conditions for free will, we conducted a cross-cultural and cross-linguistic survey (N = 5,268) spanning twenty countries and sixteen languages. Overall, participants tended to ascribe moral responsibility whether the perpetrator lacked sourcehood or alternate possibilities. However, for American, European, and Middle Eastern participants, being the ultimate source of one’s actions promoted perceptions of free will and control as well as ascriptions of blame and punishment. By contrast, being the source of one’s actions was not particularly salient to Asian participants. Finally, across cultures, participants exhibiting greater cognitive reflection were more likely to view free will as incompatible with causal determinism. We discuss these findings in light of documented cultural differences in the tendency toward dispositional versus situational attributions. © Copyright © 2019 Hannikainen, Machery, Rose, Stich, Olivola, Sousa, Cova, Buchtel, Alai, Angelucci, Berniûnas, Chatterjee, Cheon, Cho, Cohnitz, Dranseika, Eraña Lagos, Ghadakpour, Grinberg, Hashimoto, Horowitz, Hristova, Jraissati, Kadreva, Karasawa, Kim, Kim, Lee, Mauro, Mizumoto, Moruzzi, Ornelas, Osimani, Romero, Rosas López, Sangoi, Sereni, Songhorian, Struchiner, Tripodi, Usui, Vázquez del Mercado, Vosgerichian, Zhang and Zhu.",alternate possibilities; cognitive style; compatibilism; dispositionism; free will; situationism; sourcehood,"Department of Law, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Department of Philosophy, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, United States; Department of Philosophy, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States; Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Institute of Cognition and Culture, Queen’s University, Belfast, United Kingdom; Department of Philosophy, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; Department of Psychology, The Education University of Hong Kong, Tai Po, Hong Kong; Department of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy; Institute of Psychology, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania; School of Cognitive Science, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India; Department of Philosophy, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea; Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands; Institute of Philosophy, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania; Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas-UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico; Independent Researcher, Tehran, Iran; Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology, New Bulgarian University, Sofia, Bulgaria; Department of Social Psychology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of History, Philosophy and Judaic Studies, Open University of Israel, Ra’anana, Israel; Department of Philosophy, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon; Department of Psychology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea; Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; CLOO Behavioral Insights Unit, Porto, Portugal; School of Knowledge Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Ishikawa, Japan; Department of Philosophy and Communication Studies, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí, Mexico; Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, Ludwig Maximilians Universität, Munich, Germany; Department of Philosophy, National University of Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia; Faculty of Philosophy, Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS, Pavia, Italy; Faculty of Philosophy, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy; Department of Philosophy and Educational Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy; Department of Humanities, Mie University, Tsu, Japan; School of Humanities, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; School of Information Management, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China",English

The objective assessment of harmful alcohol use can be done using laboratory measures of serum biomarkers. For community-based patients, there is often a requirement of an alternative method due to lack of onsite laboratory services. The aim of the study was to examine filter paper as a matrix to measure serum biomarkers of harmful alcohol use. Methods: The initial phase involved standardization of the filter-paper-based assay. Conditions were optimised for extraction and estimation of alcohol biomarkers (Aspartate Aminotransferase; AST, Alanine Aminotransferase; ALT, Gamma Glutamyl transferase; GGT and Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin; CDT) from the filter paper. For clinical validation, serum samples were collected from community clinics. Biomarker levels obtained from both the methods were correlated using linear regression analysis. Limits of agreement between the two methods was estimated using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Results: The extraction of enzymes (AST, ALT and GGT) from filter paper was carried out using the substrate buffer available with the reagent kit (Randox, UK). CDT was readily extracted from filter paper using deionised water. Serum biomarker levels measured from samples collected from community clinics correlated well with filter paper extracted levels (ICC 0.97-0.99). More than 90% of alcohol biomarker levels were recovered from the filter paper matrix using this method.

Several lines of evidence have implicated cortical regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and insular cortex along with the hippocampus in the top–down modulation of anxiety-like behaviour in animal models. Both rodent models of anxiety, as well as treatment with anxiolytic drugs, result in the concomitant activation of multiple forebrain regions. Here, we sought to examine the effects of chemogenetic activation or inhibition of forebrain principal neurons on anxiety and despair-like behaviour. We acutely activated or inhibited Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CamKIIα)-positive forebrain excitatory neurons using the hM3Dq or the hM4Di Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) respectively. Circuit activation was confirmed via an increase in expression of the immediate early gene, c-Fos, within both the hippocampus and the neocortex. We then examined the influence of DREADD-mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons on behavioural tests for anxiety and despair-like behaviour. Our results indicate that acute hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons resulted in a significant decline in anxiety-like behaviour on the open field, light–dark avoidance, and the elevated plus maze test. In contrast, hM3Dq DREADD activation of forebrain excitatory neurons did not alter despair-like behaviour on either the tail suspension or forced swim tests. Acute hM4Di DREADD inhibition of CamKIIα-positive forebrain excitatory neurons did not modify either anxiety or despair-like behaviour. Taken together, our results demonstrate that chemogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the forebrain decreases anxiety-like behaviour in mice. © Copyright © 2019 Salvi, Pati, Chaudhari, Tiwari, Banerjee and Vaidya.",anxiety; clozapine-N-oxide; DREADD; elevated plus maze; hM3Dq; hM4Di; light–dark avoidance test; open field test,"Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India",English

Based on samples collected through a combination of spatial random sampling and link-tracing strategies, and applying population-based calibrations, we find that the worst the forms of child labor are widespread and pervasive among child workers in urban Bihar, irrespective of whether we apply the Indian legal framework or the international convention. Such pervasive exploitation and abuse of child labor in one Indian state suggest the need to develop solutions that must address the fundamental social forces that compel children to work in slave-like conditions, such as basic livable wages for adult laborers and greater enforcement of existing child protection laws to ensure proper scrutiny of places where children are employed. It will take a long-term commitment from the Indian government as well as the civil society to tackle such a large-scale social problem, and interventions aiming to bring about significant social changes, such as improved enforcement of existing child labor law, public education and awareness campaign, financial as well as legal punishment of egregious employers. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",child labor; Human trafficking; labor trafficking; link-tracing sampling; modern slavery; prevalence estimation,"School of Criminology and Justice Studies, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, United States; Office of the Advancement of Research, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York, NY, United States; Kyle Vincent, Independent Consultant, Ottawa, Canada; Research Division, Praxis:Institute for Participatory Practices, New Delhi, India",English

Impairments in social and occupational functioning are likely related to neurocognition but are rarely targeted by existing treatments for OCD. Previous studies of cognitive training in OCD have been limited by narrow transfer of effects. We report a case of an individual referred for cognitive training in view of persisting cognitive and functional difficulties despite clinical improvement. The intervention consisted of therapist-guided sessions along with homework practice. A smartphone application was developed for cognitive stimulation, and used with other techniques for cognitive stimulation, strategy use, and generalization to achieve transfer of effects. Following 12 weeks of intervention, changes were observed on executive functions including verbal fluency and planning, and smaller changes across measures of attention and working memory. Notably, there was simultaneous reduction on severity of anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Further, there was improvement in subjectively perceived cognitive difficulties as well as work, family and social functioning. The cognitive training intervention has promising implications for individuals with OCD with persisting cognitive and functional impairments despite clinical improvement. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cognitive remediation; Cognitive training; Functional impairment; Obsessive compulsive disorder,"Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, India; Gutermann Technologies, India; Cloud Based Solutions, India; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, India",English

The Brief Sensation Seeking Scale - Chinese (BSSS-C; Chen et al., 2013) is a less culture specific tool with excellent psychometric properties and presents a suitable option for use with Indian adolescents. Aim: The present study aims to validate the factor structure, evaluate the psychometric properties, and examine the gender invariance of the BSSS-C in Indian adolescents. Methods: A community sample of adolescent, n = 2079, with mean age 17 years (SD = 1.71) completed the BSSS-C, the BIS/BAS, and the Adolescent Risky Behaviour scales. Results: The four factor structure of the BSSS-C exhibited good to excellent model fit, acceptable internal consistency reliability (α = 0.77) and, adequate construct as well as concurrent validity in Indian adolescents. Invariance testing revealed that the factor configuration and factor loadings of the BSSS-C were equivalent across the gender. Three of the four BSSS-C latent factors were amenable for mean comparisons across the gender. Conclusion: BSSS-C is a reliable measure of the four dimensional model of sensation seeking in Indian adolescents. The gender differences in the BSSS-C factors are attributable to real differences in sensation seeking construct between male and female adolescents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Adolescence; BSSS-C; Confirmatory factor analysis; Measurement invariance; Sensation seeking,"Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India; Department of Biostatistics, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India",English
"Das S., Mishra A., Cyr D.",Opportunity gone in a flash: Measurement of e-commerce service failure and justice with recovery as a source of e-loyalty,2019,Decision Support Systems,"Online flash sales (OFS) are an opportunity for customers to purchase goods with large discounts for a limited period, along with the increased risk of service failures due to heavy demand for such offers. The current work examines the impact of OFS e-commerce service failures, as well as that of perceived customer opportunism (PCO), on perceived justice with service recovery (PJWSR), post-recovery satisfaction (SSR), post-recovery perceived switching cost (PSC) and e-loyalty. By using a mixed-method approach, the current work develops a novel framework for OFS e-commerce service failure. Failure is conceptualized as functional, information, and system failures, with unique sub-dimensions/measurement items underlying each. Our findings suggest that functional and information failures have a negative effect on PJWSR, PCO has a positive effect on PJWSR, PJWSR has a significant effect on SSR/PSC and SSR positively affects e-loyalty, with no moderation of PSC on this relationship. This work contributes to the e-commerce service failure and customer opportunism literature by proposing a new contextual scale for measuring OFS e-commerce service failures and the impact of recovery-induced justice on a customer's loyalty. Leveraging this work, e-tailers need to make judicious decisions to avoid specific failures during OFS by designing robust e-commerce systems and, in the case of a failure, to have a responsive recovery protocol to enhance PJWSR and subsequent e-loyalty. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Customer opportunism; E-loyalty; Functional failure; Information failure; Perceived justice; System failure,"Vinod Gupta School of Management, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, WB, India; Indian Institute of Management, Prabandh Shikhar, Rau-Pithampur Road, Indore, MP, India; Beedie School of Business, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada",English
"Saini S., Sahula V.",Language Learnability Analysis of Hindi: A Comparison with Ideal and Constrained Learning Approaches,2019,Journal of Psycholinguistic Research,"Native language acquisition is one of the initial processes undertaken by the human brain in the infant stage of life. The linguist community has always been interested in finding the method, which is adopted by the human brain to acquire the native language. Word segmentation in one of the most important tasks in acquiring the language. Statistical learning has been employed to be one of the earliest strategies that mimic the way an infant can adapt to segment a lot of different words. It is desired that the language learnability theories be universal in nature and work on most, if not all the languages. In the present work, we have analyzed the learnability of Hindi, the most popular Indian language, using ideal (universal) and constrained Bayesian learner models. We have analyzed the learnability of the language using unigram and bigram approaches by considering word, syllables, and phonemes as the smallest unit of the language. We demonstrate that Bayesian inference is indeed a viable cross-linguistic strategy and works well for Hindi also. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bayesian learners; Hindi Language; Language acquisition; Language learnability,"Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, 302031, India; Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, 302017, India",English
"Bhaskar A.U., Mishra B.",Putting workplace spirituality in context: Examining its role in enhancing career satisfaction and reducing turnover intentions with perceived organizational support as an antecedent,2019,Personnel Review,"Purpose: Workplace spirituality (WPS) has emerged as a key concept in management literature but has, thus far, remained inadequately explored in research studies. The purpose of this paper is to draw WPS upon the organizational support theory and WPS literature to develop and test a model. The role of WPS and its moderating effect is examined in its relationship with perceived organizational support (POS), career satisfaction (CS) and turnover intentions (TIs). Design/methodology/approach: Using a survey research design, data were collected from 314 respondents to test the proposed model. Serial mediation was tested using the two dimensions of WPS (meaningful work (MW) and sense of community (SC)) as mediators between POS and CS. For moderation, these two dimensions of WPS were used to test the variables of POS and TI. Findings: This study found that the relationship between POS and CS is sequentially mediated by the two dimensions of WPS, namely, MW and SC, while WPS is found to enhance CS among employees, it has been found to significantly reduce their TIs by moderating the relationship between POS and TI. Thus, employee TIs are found to be lower when the relationship between POS and MW is stronger. Practical implications: The findings of this study will help managers develop strategies and formulate effective interventions that would improve the CS of employees and reduce their intentions to quit, leading to desirable individual and organizational outcomes. Originality/value: WPS is a relatively new construct both at the workplace and in academia and to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study which has examined the role of WPS in the relationship between POS, CS and TIs. By examining how organizational support has a significant influence on the employee in shaping positive work attitudes, the study will contribute to the existing knowledge and address questions hitherto unexplored. The findings of this research will thus have direct implications for the practitioner as well as the manager. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Career satisfaction; Perceived organizational support; Quantitative; Turnover intentions; Workplace spirituality,"Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad, India; Indian Institute of Management Ranchi, Ranchi, India",English
Chaudhary A.,Living Through an Early Pregnancy Loss: an Autoethnographic Account,2019,Human Arenas,"Challenging the norm of silence around miscarriages in Indian society, this paper is my attempt at reflecting, documenting, and sharing the personal experience of living through an early pregnancy loss and subsequent grief. Here, I narrate the story of my “delayed miscarriage” and reflect on the implicit social scripts associated with pregnancy and motherhood in Indian metropolitan context. Additionally, I share the details of my encounters with various healthcare practitioners during the course of my short-lived pregnancy while simultaneously critiquing the healthcare practices adopted for patients of early pregnancy loss at hospitals in metropolitan cities in India. Methodologically, the inquiry adopts an autoethnographic approach wherein the researcher uses personal storytelling, self-reflection, and analysis to illuminate and theorize the cultural experiences and psychosocial meaning-making processes. “Pressures and contradictions of pregnancy scripts,” “silent suffering and discounting of loss,” “mystery of loss and meaning making,” “alienation,” “objectification of the pregnant body,” and “busy business of healthcare” emerged as significant themes for discussion in the autoethnographic account. Through a discussion of these themes, I highlight the ways in which the implicit cultural scripts attached to pregnancy and motherhood take away agency from women. I further argue for the necessity of challenging the prevailing the trend of silent mourning after miscarriages in India to promote mental health and well-being of women. With respect to the healthcare practices in India, I advocate for implementation of an ethically grounded biopsychosocial approach to caring for early pregnancy loss to restore women’s agency. Finally, reaffirming the autoethnographic stance, I discuss the possibility of healing through research and writing in the end. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Alienation; Autoethnography; Bereavement; Cultural scripts; Delayed miscarriage; Early pregnancy loss; Healthcare,"Department of Psychology, Indraprastha College for Women, University of Delhi, 31-Shamnath Marg, Civil Lines, Delhi, 110054, India",English

Design: A randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded trial. Setting: Rehabilitation institute. Participants: Thirty-six chronic poststroke (15.89 ± 9.01 months) hemiparetic subjects (age: 46.44 ± 7.89 years, 30 men and functional ambulation classification of median level 3). Interventions: Activity-based MT comprised movements such as ball-rolling, rocker-board, and pedalling. The activities were provided on the less-affected side in front of the mirror while hiding the affected limb. The movement of the less-affected lower limb was projected as over the affected limb. Conventional motor therapy based on neurophysiological approaches was also provided to the experimental group. The control group received only conventional management. Main outcome measures: Brunnstrom recovery stages (BRS), Fugl-Meyer assessment lower extremity (FMA-LE), Rivermead visual gait assessment (RVGA), and 10-metre walk test (10-MWT). Results: Postintervention, the experimental group exhibited significant and favourable changes for FMA-LE (mean difference = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.23–5.35, p =.003) and RVGA (mean difference = 5.41, 95% CI = 1.12–9.71, p =.015) in comparison to the control group.

There is a dearth of psychosocial literature on SPS in India. This qualitative study explored the perspectives about the illness, attitudes, and caregiving experiences of SPS. Materials and Methods: Qualitative audio-recorded interviews were conducted with 15 SPS, purposively selected from a tertiary mental health hospital of Southern India. A general inductive approach was adopted to analyze the qualitative data. Results: Four broad themes were identified from qualitative data analysis. (1) SPS described several explanatory models of mental illness in terms of causal attributions and treatment care. (2) They had expressed emotion toward their ill siblings, such as criticality, hostility, and emotional over-involvement. (3) They experienced objective and subjective burden while caring for their ill sibling. In spite of all these, (4) they were part of their ill siblings' care in terms of ensuring regular follow-ups and drug adherence and supported their livelihood. They coped up with adaptive as well as maladaptive strategies. Conclusion: SPS provide significant support to their affected siblings. However, they do have non-biomedical models of mental illness and negative attitudes toward patients and experience burden. Hence, psychosocial interventions may help SPS while caregiving for their affected siblings. © 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Experiences; explanatory models; expressed emotion; Schizophrenia; siblings,"Department of Sociology and Social Work, CHRIST (Deemed to Be University), Hosur Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka, 560 029, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Hosur Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India; Department of Psychiatric Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Hosur Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

Results indicated that indiscriminately using social media data can lead to biased inferences about career outcomes. Specifically, social media data matched survey data in just 67% to 76% of comparisons. Despite these limitations, findings also revealed strategies to improve agreement between data sources, leading to more trustworthy inferences about career outcomes from social media.

Maniar V.,Towards a Theory of Schooling for Good Life in Postcolonial Societies,2019,Journal of Human Values,"Schools often aim at creating opportunities for good life and at promoting a good society. Liberal theorization on schooling is premised on a functioning liberal democracy with a capitalist economy. However, postcolonial societies are characterized by poverty and inequality, cultural diversity, and an ongoing project of state and nation building. This challenges some of the foundational assumptions of liberal conceptions of schooling aimed at promoting good life and good society in postcolonial societies. Realization of good life through schools is shaped both by shaping of ‘consciousness, identities, and desires’ [Bernstein (2000, Pedagogy, symbolic control, and identity: Theory, research, critique, Lanhan, MD: Rowman & Littlefield)] and through imparting knowledge and skills that help realize these desires in particular contexts. These schooling practices have different influences on opportunities for good life in short, medium, and long terms in these societies. A conceptual model of schooling that addresses these complexities is key to understanding the processes that influence the opportunities for a pursuit of good life through schooling in postcolonial societies. Such a model could draw upon the existing theories of liberal schooling but would have to adapt them to respond to the contexts of postcolonial societies. © 2019 SAGE Publications.",education; Good life; postcolonial; school; well-being,"School of Education, Azim Premji University, Bangalore, India",English

Knowledge, attitude and practice of primary caregivers towards children with ASD are important factors in promoting health and wellness of such children. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of video-assisted teaching regarding care of children with ASD on knowledge, attitude and practice among primary caregivers. Design/methodology/approach: Quasi-experimental research design with one group pre-test post-test was adopted. A total of 60 primary caregivers were selected through stratified random sampling technique. Video-assisted teaching was given to 60 primary caregivers.

Unfortunately, few studies have addressed multidimensional child poverty in this region. Using novel data generated from 431 randomly selected households in the Boucle du Mouhoun region in Burkina Faso, the Alkire–Foster methodology was applied to estimate and decompose multidimensional poverty among adolescent children. Ten dimensions guided by the child poverty literature, data availability and the country’s SDGs were used. While deprivations in water and sanitation (89%), health (75%), nutrition (82%), and child labour (48.7%) were found to be more prevalent in the rural areas, child subjective well-being (73%) and child protection (61%) were more pronounced in the urban areas. Analysis of multiple overlaps in dimensions shows that all of the children suffer from deprivations in three or more dimensions simultaneously. Furthermore, when the poverty cut-off values were set at k = 20% (“Vulnerable to Poverty”), k = 30% (“Multidimensionally Poor”) and k = 50% (“Poverty Severity”), close to 95% of children are categorized as being in “Severe Poverty”, 68% as “Multidimensionally Poor”, and 38% as being “Vulnerable to Poverty”. Using binary logistic regressions, household size, age and marital status of household head, locality of child, income source, debt status, education, number of siblings, gender of child, adults and maternal health condition were found to be significantly correlated to poverty vulnerability, multidimensionally poor and poverty severity in the region.

Aims & objectives: To explore the acceptability and perception of patients towards various psychiatric treatments, with specific focus on LAIs. Additionally the study aimed to compare the acceptability of various types of treatments including LAIs between patients with severe mental disorders (Psychotic disorders and Bipolar disorder) and those with Common mental disorders (Anxiety, neurotic and depressive disorders). Methodology: A self-designed semi-structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the preferred treatment options of all the new patients attending the psychiatry outpatient clinic of a tertiary care hospital. Depending on the response, they were further probed for the reasons for accepting or rejecting the LAIs. Results: 2659 patients were interviewed who were divided into two groups (Group I - 321 subjects with psychotic disorders and 120 subjects with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and Group II – 2218 subjects with neurotic, stress-related and unipolar depressive disorders). More than three-fourth (78.8%) of the participants in the whole study sample opted for tablets only as their first preferred choice and injectables were opted by about 5% of the participants only, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. After being explained about LAIs, one fourth of the participants (24.9%) reported that they may consider LAIs, without any significant difference between the 2 groups. Among those who refused to take LAIs even after explanation, the commonly reported reasons were difficulty in visiting hospital frequently for the injectables (41.69%), injectables being painful (19.41%), fear of injections (13.96%), no need to take LAIs (12.45%) and preference to take some other types of medicines (8.52%). Conclusions: Considering the fact that LAIs are highly underused in patients with severe mental disorders and there is lack of awareness about LAIs among patients with severe mental disorders, the present study findings suggest that there is reasonable level of acceptance of LAIs among patients with severe mental disorders when explained about the same. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Long acting injectables; Treatment acceptance; Treatment preferences,"Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India; Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector-32, Chandigarh, India",English

As, we are well aware the web provides information related all the fields like national, lifestyle, movies, shopping, spirituality, sports, entertainment and much more. One cannot assume that the web retrieved information is believable or trustworthy due to multiple answers to the same query. The paper aims to study many research articles which are related to truth information discovery. However, the paper found that there is no proper research to find trustworthiness of news content which is extracted from multiple information sources with minimum misclassification error and retrieval time. To alleviate these issues, the truth content discovery algorithm is proposed to produce trustworthy information with minimal time along with multiple domain news information. The system provides reliable information from a various source of news provider with minimum classification error. The proposed method ranked the news content index based on query matches from extracted information. It minimizes the query retrieval time and classification error. Based on the experimental evaluation, proposed TCD + J48 algorithm produced the best result compared to existing approaches.

Findings: This study evaluated the effect of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) gene silencing using MMP-2 shRNA expression plasmids (pMMP-2) on IR induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage by MTT, dead green, γH2AX and comet assays in human normal dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. IR has decreased the viability of HDFs and MCF-7 cells with increasing IR (2-10Gy). IR induced DNA damage in both HDFs and MCF-7 cells. However, pMMP-2 transfection has increased the viability of irradiated HDFs (10Gy) and significantly decreased the viability of irradiated MCF-7 cells (10Gy). Further, DNA damage in terms of γH2AX foci decreased with pMMP-2 transfection in irradiated HDFs (10Gy) and increased in irradiated MCF-7 cells (10Gy). In addition, MMP-2 gene silencing using pMMP-2 decreased comet tail length in irradiated HDFs but increased in irradiated MCF-7 cells. Conclusions: The results conclude that pMMP-2 has protected HDFs and sensitized the MCF-7 cells from IR induced DNA damage. This differential response might be due to IR induced MMP-2 distinctive ROS generation in HDFs and MCF-7 cells. © 2019 The Author(s).",Breast cancer; DNA damage; Fibroblasts; Ionizing radiation; Matrix metalloproteinase,"Cancer Biology Lab, Department of Biochemistry and Bioinformatics, Institute of Science, GITAM, Deemed to Be University, Visakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh, India; Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Science, GITAM Deemed to Be University, Visakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh, India",English
"Baral R., Sampath P.",Exploring the moderating effect of susceptibility to emotional contagion in the crossover of work–family conflict in supervisor–subordinate dyads in India,2019,Personnel Review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the applicability of a crossover model of work–family conflict (WFC) in the work setting among supervisor–subordinate dyads. It examines the positive association between supervisor’s WFC and subordinate’s WFC and analyses the moderating effect of subordinate’s susceptibility to emotional contagion (SEC). Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered using a questionnaire survey method and tested in 193 matched supervisor–subordinate dyads from select organisations representing the services sector in India. Findings: The authors found a significant direct crossover path from the supervisor to his/her subordinate’s WFC. The effect of supervisor reported WFC on subordinate reported WFC was found to be strong when the subordinate displayed higher SEC with his/her supervisor. Research limitations/implications: Examining the crossover of WFC contributes to theory by broadening crossover research to include transmission of negative experiences in the work context. This study significantly adds to emotional contagion theory by substantiating the existence of WFC contagion in supervisor–subordinate dyads. Given the constraints of cross-sectional research design, future research should replicate these findings using a larger sample in other cultural contexts as well to generalise the results. Future research should consider using longitudinal data and including information from both the supervisor and the subordinates collected at different points in time. Crossover of positive work–family experiences (e.g. work–family enrichment) and the role of other individual difference variables such as the personality of the subordinates, empathy, etc., could also be considered. Practical implications: Supervisors should be advised of the potential adverse effects of their WFC and organisations should be made cognizance of the impact that the WFC of employees can have on their job outcomes. Organisations should provide the required formal and informal support to their employees to deal with their WFC efficiently. Originality/value: This study has attempted to examine the crossover of WFC in supervisor–subordinate dyads and the potential effect of one of the individual difference variables namely SEC. To the best of the authors knowledge, it has rarely been examined earlier. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Emotional contagion; Supervisor–subordinate dyad; Work-life balance; Work–family conflict,"Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras, Chennai, India",English
"Rajesh J.I., Prikshat V., Shum P., Suganthi L.",Follower emotional intelligence: A mediator between transformational leadership and follower outcomes,2019,Personnel Review,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of transformational leadership (TL) on follower emotional intelligence (EI) and examine the potential mediation role played by follower EI in the relationship between TL and follower outcomes (i.e. growth satisfaction in the job and job stress (JS)). Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained through survey using questionnaire collected from 908 employees who worked across six different sectors, i.e. manufacturing, IT, healthcare, hospitality, educational and public services in Southern India. The mediation model proposed in this study was tested using structural equation modelling and bootstrapping method. Findings: The relationship between TL and Follower EI was significant. Follower EI was found to partially mediate the relationship between TL and followers’ growth satisfaction in job. Contrary to expectations, the follower EI did not significantly predict JS in this study and hence the follower EI did not mediate in the proposed model. However, follower EI and growth satisfaction in the job jointly mediated the relationship between TL and follower JS fully. Research limitations/implications: Self-report bias about supervisors’ TL behaviours and followers’ own EI assessment and collection of data from the mono-source (subordinate self-report) might have impacted the results of this study. Moreover, some items were negatively worded and reverse coded as cognitive speed bumps to restrain the respondent’s tendency to rush through answering the survey questionnaire. Practical implications: This study established a partial and joint mediation of follower EI on the relationship between TL and follower outcomes. Basing on these findings, this study highlights the need for the practitioners to better understand the importance of EI training for the leaders in the organisations for obtaining better outcomes in the followers. Social implications: The study establishes the fact that the attunement of transformational leaders’ EI and follower EI help leaders as well as followers to guide their behaviour towards positive outcomes. Originality/value: This study is among the first to examine the impact of TL on follower EI and the potential mediation of follower EI between TL and follower outcomes. From a theoretical perspective, this study is one step closer to fully understand the intervening process between TL and follower outcomes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Emotional intelligence; Growth satisfaction in the job; Job stress; Quantitative; Transformational leadership,"University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia; Cardiff School of Management, Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cardiff, United Kingdom; School of Management, Western Sydney University – Penrith Campus, Sydney, Australia; Department of Management Studies, Anna University, Chennai, India",English
"Vidya S., Patlolla V., Kamuju N., Ampalam P., Kalyan V.",Impact of shift work on sleep and quality of life in industrial workers: A cross sectional study,2019,Archives of Mental Health,"Introduction: Shift work is associated with impaired sleep patterns, poor quality of life (QOL), and several medical conditions. Shift work disrupts the sleep-wake cycle and biological rhythms. Poor sleep quality and disruption of the normal circadian cycle are likely to cause cardiovascular disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, anxiety, depression, lethargy, and fatigue. It is also associated with diminished vigilance and work performance. Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of shift work on quality of sleep and QOL in industrial workers. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional, comparative study conducted on 147 rotating shift work employees and 132 regular nonshift day workers in various industries. Semi-structured pro forma was used for sociodemographic data. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to assess the quality of sleep. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index and WHOQOL-BREF were used to assess the QOL. Appropriate statistical methods were used to analyze the data. Results: Compared with nonshift day workers, those work for variable shifts exhibited higher rates of heavy smoking and increased caffeine consumption. Variable shift workers reported persistent sleep disturbance, poor sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness compared to fixed day shift workers (P < 0.05). The overall QOL score and well-being index were also significantly (P < 0.05) low in shift workers compared to nonshift day workers. Conclusion: Shift work has a significant negative impact on quality of sleep and QOL and results in poor functioning and disturbances in mental and physical health of the individual. Hence, attention must be paid to the strategies that can improve the quality of sleep and QOL. © 2020 Archives of Mental Health | Published by Wolters Kluwer ‑ Medknow",Industrial workers; quality of life; quality of sleep; shift work,"Department of Psychiatry, Maharajah's Institute of Medical Sciences, Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India; Senior Resident, Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Siddipet, Telangana, India; Department of Psychiatry, Maharajah's Institute of Medical Sciences, Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India; Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Siddipet, Telangana, India; Department of Psychiatry, Maharajah's Institute of Medical Sciences, Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India",English

The effectiveness of an integrative approach to DMP was explored on the parenting stress experienced by the caregivers of children on the autism spectrum. The present study was conducted in India. Twelve caregivers of children on the autism spectrum from different regions of India were recruited from a special education setting. They were divided into experimental (intervention) and control groups (waiting list) and were evaluated before and after six DMP group sessions. Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) were the tools used for assessment. The comparisons of pre and post intervention assessments indicate reduction in parenting stress scores after DMP intervention. The results suggest that integrative approach to DMP may be an effective option to support the caregivers of children on the autism spectrum to maintain their state of wellbeing. Difficulty in recruiting the participants and to assign them randomly were the limitations of this study. However, the findings of the study merit further explorations with larger samples and in-depth study of the therapeutic process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Autism Spectrum Disorders; Caregivers; Dance movement psychotherapy; Depression; Parenting stress,"Graduate Teaching Assistant, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk, United Kingdom; Professor of Dance, Arts and Wellbeing, Department of Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk, United Kingdom; Assistant Professor (Speech Pathology), Composite Regional Centre for Persons with Disabilities, Devaraj Urs Layout B Block, Davangere, India; Director and Professor in Speech Pathology, Department of Speech Language Pathology, All India Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH), Mysore, India",English

"Meena S., Patil G.R., Mondal A.",Understanding mode choice decisions for shopping mall trips in metro cities of developing countries,2019,Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,"The traditional travel demand model for an urban region generally considers work trips as the major constituent which subsequently attracts the maximum focus on mode choice analysis. However, with the increase in traffic-related problems coupled with the evolving lifestyle of people in general, it has become imperative to focus on trips intended for other purposes as well. In most of the urban scenarios, shopping trips constitute the second most frequented trips after work trips. The present study aims to develop a mode choice model exclusively for shopping malls in Mumbai city and determine the factors which influence a trip maker's behavior of mode choice in the context of a developing country. Choice of mode for shopping mall trips is important in relation to the impact of the vehicular traffic generated from the shopping malls on the adjacent road networks as well as in the planning of the parking space allocations at the malls along with providing critical insights on the influential factors to the transport planners for policy recommendation. Revealed Preference (RP) survey technique is used to collect 650 samples of data regarding trip makers’ choice of mode to shopping malls by interviewing individuals at various shopping malls across Mumbai. A Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is initially developed, followed by a Nested Logit (NL) model by grouping the private modes in a single nest. The significance level of the variables used in both the models are mostly consistent. Both the models reveal that travel time has a significant role in the mode choice behavior. While walking time and access time notably affect the utility of public transport mode, factors like number of accompanying persons and driving license possession also influence the private modes significantly. Socio-demographic characteristics like age, gender and occupation are also found to be critical in the mode choice behavior for shopping mall trips. A comparative analysis of the MNL and NL models reveals that the NL model outperforms the MNL model both in terms of goodness of fit and prediction success rate. However, both the models (MNL with a predictive success rate of over 72% and NL with a predictive success rate of about 77%) fairly captures the factors affecting the mode choice behavior for trips to shopping malls. The study can help policy makers to understand the factors affecting the choice of mode for such trips and can aid in planning strategies to minimize traffic congestion resulting from the increasing number of shopping malls. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Developing cities; Mode choice; Nested logit model; Shopping mall trips,"Department of Civil Engineering, M.B.M.

"Lamba K., Singh S.P.",Dynamic supplier selection and lot-sizing problem considering carbon emissions in a big data environment,2019,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Selection of the right suppliers with a view of overall reduction in the procurement cost as well as carbon emissions is an important task for the buyers to sustain in the fierce competitive environment. The rising concerns about carbon emissions due to severe climatic changes globally have forced supply chain managers to restrategize about controlling their carbon emissions. This paper proposes a dynamic supplier selection model incorporating the carbon emissions under the carbon cap-and-trade scenario. Carbon emissions caused due to ordering, holding the inventory, production and handling and transportation have been considered in the paper. The proposed mathematical model is a mixed-integer-non-linear-program (MINLP).

The bulk of research on positive mental health tends to be largely based onwestern developed nationconceptualizations. This highlights the need to examine the construct of positive mental health in diverse socio-cultural contexts. Present study aimed at exploring indicators and dimensions of positive mental health in Indian adults.

The sample consisted of a panel of 35 experts from different regions of India, majority of whom had >10 years of professional experience. Using a bottom-up approach, content analysis of the emergent data in terms of responses of experts to 10 vignettes resulted in identification and operationalisation of 33 indicators which could be grouped under 13 dimensions. Comparisons with popular well-being frameworks indicated that eight of these could be considered newer dimensions.

To address this gap, the present study analysed focus group discussions with 42 South Indian and 48 European children aged 8 to 17 years. During the discussions, the children were asked about what makes them happy and sad and about what helps them feel good again when they feel sad. The data were analysed based on grounded theory. Data analysis revealed the following seven themes: ‘Indian and European children attach different values to school’, ‘interactions with biological families both support and threaten well-being’, ‘positive and negative effects of relationships on the self’, ‘Indian and European children name different exclusive well-being sources’, ‘cross-cultural and culture-specific coping and relaxation strategies’, ‘staying physically healthy is important to the children’s well-being’, and ‘material and economic resources are clearly linked with children’s well-being’. Moreover, the results suggest that the meaning of the well-being themes is shaped by a child’s self-construal, which is either independent (the self is separated from others) or interdependent (the self is connected with others).

Depression is a common occurrence among PLHIV and is elevated in those who consume alcohol. This paper will document the presence of depressive symptoms in alcohol-consuming male PLHIV receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) in India. It examines the correlates of depressive symptoms and uses the data from in-depth interviews to explain the nature of the statistical relationships obtained from an NIH-funded a multilevel, multi-centric intervention study. A cross-sectional, baseline survey was administered to 940 alcohol consuming, male PLHIV in five hospital-based ART Centers in urban Maharashtra, India via face to face interviews from October 2015 to April 2016. An additional 55 men were recruited independently to engage in in-depth interviews on alcohol use and other factors related to adherence. The results of the survey showed that approximately 38% of PLHIV reported having moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with higher levels of family-related concerns (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.12–1.23), work difficulties (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.69–2.69) and HIV-related self-stigma (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.03–1.07) and a lower level of ART service satisfaction (OR 0.58 95% CI 0.44–0.77). The results of in-depth interviews showed that PLHIV’s tenshun (a Hindi term most closely corresponding to depressive symptoms) resulted from feelings of guilt and concerns about how family, friends, and neighbors might react to their HIV status and the potential for loss of a job as a result of disclosure of their HIV status at work. The level of depressive symptoms among male PLHIV involved in ART treatment points to the need to strengthen the psychological component of PLHIV treatment in India. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Depressive symptoms; Family-related concerns; HIV; Self-stigma; tenshun,"Department of Community Medicine and Health Care, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT  06030, United States; Institute for Community Research, Hartford, CT, United States; Yale School of Public Health, Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, New Haven, CT, United States; International Center for Research on Women, Asia Regional Office, Mumbai, India; Population Council, Mumbai, India",English

The present study intends to unfold the trust formation phenomena of the newcomer employees where organizational justice perception leads to trust through organizational trustworthiness. Interactions between the dimensions of organizational justice perception and trustworthiness towards trust are the focal point of the study. We further propose that a moderated mediation model explains the trust formation phenomena comprehensively. Findings suggests that supervisor referent interpersonal justice moderates the indirect relationship between organizational justice and trust. Procedural and interactional justice also have significant relationships with trust through all the three dimensions of trustworthiness. The results indicated a full mediation for procedural justice and a partial mediation for interactional justice.

Bhullar N.,Parental experiences with an adolescent female and male with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in India,2019,Advances in Autism,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to compare experiences of two parents of adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) differing in gender, including their daily routines at school and at home, challenging behaviour, social support and future plans for their children. Design/methodology/approach: The parents of the two adolescents with ASD were interviewed with open-ended questions related to their children as well as their personal experiences, along with getting their individual responses for the established Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Findings: There were similarities and differences in the parents’ experiences with their adolescent children with ASD. Similarities included a limited social support outside their families, hopes for the future of their children, where in they emphasised the need for some “normality” for their child, and a lack of plan in terms of legal guardianship and written wills after their own time. Some of the differences were also noted in the parents’ description of symptoms of their children, with the father of the female adolescent reporting more negative experiences both with his child, as well as with his spouse, a lack of social support and, subsequently, more “dissatisfaction” on the SWLS than the mother of the male adolescent. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of this study is the absence of feedback from the other parent besides the one being interviewed, due to which only one parental perspective was provided here. Social implications: There are vital social implications of this study. Both parents reported a limited social support due to which they expressed the need for increasing awareness for ASD in the general society. These findings illustrate the need for a focus on designing interventions for improving outcomes for both parent and child in similar situations.

Among the three fluorescent molecular rotors (FMR), 4c exhibited excellent viscosity sensitivity with x value = 0.687. The Non-linear (NLO) characters are estimated with the help of solvatochromic and computational methods using the functionals, B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP. The dyes showed large “linear polarizability (αCT)”, “first order hyperpolarizability” (β) and “second order hyperpolarizability” (γ) values which show that synthesized styryls can be used as a “NLO” material. The αCT, β and γ for 4c are found to be the maximum amongst the all three dyes which can be ascribed to the smaller band gap apparent from experimental as well as DFT method. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",AEE; DFT; Extended styryl; FMR; NLO; Solvatochromism,"Department of Dyestuff Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, Matunga, Mumbai, 400 019, India",English
Bhattacharyya U.,Reconceptualizing Representation: Interconnections of Experience and Space in the Production of Knowledge,2019,Journal of Human Values,"Recognizing the centrality of representation in philosophy and social sciences as constitutive of knowledge concerning the interpretation of social reality, this article highlights on the need to engage in a reconceptualization of the notion of representation in order to comprehend the contextual nature of knowledge production in society. Acknowledging the significance of space in the production of discourses of power as well as resistance, it looks at how representation, fundamental to the formation of knowledge, can also be seen as cognitive categories or objects symbolizing hegemonic discourses as well as alternative ideas, challenging the dominant structures of authority. Stressing on the related categories of experience, representation and social space, this article therefore throws light on the complex interaction between representation, human cognition, social structures and counter-hegemonic processes in the continual production of knowledge. © 2019 SAGE Publications.",experience; knowledge; power; Representation; space,"Department of Sociology, Sri Venkateswara College (University of Delhi), New Delhi, India",English
Kapoor H.,Sex differences and similarities in negative creativity,2019,Personality and Individual Differences,"Negative creativity is using the creative process to meet a negative goal, without the deliberate intent to harm. This report investigates whether sex differences exist in the expression of negative creativity. Secondary data across four experiments (N = 641, 293 women) using divergent thinking tasks were compared for differences in positive and negative creativity, between and within men and women. Results showed that all but one result was in line with a gender similarities perspective to negative creativity, with men and women being equally negatively creative. However, greater variability was noted for men in positive creativity on object-based tasks, and for women in negative creativity. Further, whereas men were more likely to be positively than negatively creativity, women's creative performance was equivalent across valences in real-world divergent thinking tasks. This may be accounted for by differing cognitive styles adopted during creative task performance as well as creativity task effects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Divergent thinking; Individual differences; Negative creativity; Sex differences,"Monk Prayogshala, Mumbai, India",English
"Yamada Y., Watanabe S., Okamoto K., Arimoto S., Takahashi E., Negishi K., Negishi T.",Chloroethylating anticancer drug-induced mutagenesis and its repair in Escherichia coli,2019,Genes and Environment,"Background: Chloroethylnitrosourea (CENU) derivatives, such as nimustine (ACNU) and carmustine (BCNU), are employed in brain tumor chemotherapy due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. They are thought to suppress tumor development through DNA chloroethylation, followed by the formation of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) that efficiently block replication and transcription. However, the alkylation of DNA and ICLs may trigger genotoxicity, leading to tumor formation as a side effect of the chemotherapeutic treatment. Although the involvement of O 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) in repairing chloroethylated guanine (O 6-chloroethylguanine) has been reported, the exact lesion responsible for the genotoxicity and the pathway responsible for repairing it remains unclear. Results: We examined the mutations induced by ACNU and BCNU using a series of Escherichia coli strains, CC101 to CC111, in which reverse mutations due to each episome from F'101 to F'106 and frameshift mutations due to each episome from F'107 to F'111 could be detected. The mutant frequency increased in E. coli CC102, which can detect a GC to AT mutation. To determine the pathway responsible for repairing the CENU-induced lesions, we compared the frequency of mutations induced by CENU in the wild-type strain to those in the ada, ogt (AGT-deficient) strain, uvrA (nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient) strain, mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient strains, and recA (recombination deficient) strain of E. coli CC102. The frequencies of mutations induced by ACNU and BCNU increased in the ada, ogt strain, demonstrating that O 6-chloroethylguanines were formed, and that a portion was repaired by AGT. Mutation induced by ACNU in NER-deficient strain showed a similar profile to that in AGT-deficient strain, suggesting that an NER and AGT play at the similar efficacy to protect E. coli from mutation induced by ACNU. O 6-Chloroethylguanine is reported to form ICLs if it is not repaired. We examined the survival rates and the frequencies of mutations induced by ACNU and BCNU in the uvrA strain, the recA strain, as well as a double-deficient strain of CC102. The mutation profile of the double-deficient strain was similar to that of the NER-deficient strain, suggesting that an NER protects E. coli from mutations but not recombination. In addition, cell death was more pronounced in the uvrA, recA double-deficient strain than in the single-deficient strains. Conclusion: These results suggest that the toxic lesions induced by CENU were repaired additively or synergistically by NER and recombination. In other words, lesions, such as ICLs, appear to be repaired by NER and recombination independently. © 2019 The Author(s).",Carmustine (BCNU); Chloroethylnitrosourea; DNA repair; Escherichia coli; Interstrand cross-link (ICL); Nimustine (ACNU); Recombination,"Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Tsushima-naka, Kita-ku, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan; Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Tsushima-naka, Kita-ku, Okayama, 700-8530, Japan; Nihon Pharmaceutical University, Ina, Kita-Adachi-Gun, Saitama, 362-0806, Japan; Collaborative Research Center of Okayama University for Infectious Diseases in India, National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases JICA Building ID Hospital Campus, Beliaghata, Kolkata, 700010, India",English
"Ambekar A., Mishra A., Parmar A., Kumar R., Kumar M., Rao R., Agrawal A.",Are non-injecting opioid users at risk of transition to injecting drug use? A multi-site study from India,2019,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Background: Most people who inject drugs (PWID) start their drug use careers by using non-injecting opioid drugs. A variety of interconnected factors may influence the risk of transition from non-injecting to injecting drug use (IDU). However, such factors have not been studied well in India. As almost all non-injecting opioid users (NIOU) are at potential risk of switching to IDU in future, it is important to understand the phenomenon of transition. Method: In this multi-site, cross-sectional observational study, we compared injecting and non-injecting opioid users on the pattern of progression of drug use and their knowledge, attitude and belief about IDU/HIV. Data were collected from people who use drugs coming in contact with Non-Governmental Organizations providing drug treatment or HIV prevention services, in ten cities of six states located in North/North-West India. Following informed consent, a total of 1987 male participants (n = 1234 PWID and n = 753 NIOU) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors associated with risk of transition were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Result: The age of onset of heroin and other opiates as well as other substances was not different between two groups. Among PWID, a majority (n = 713; 57.77%) reported using opioids through non-injecting route before switching to injecting route. The mean duration between first use of non-injecting opioid and first use of injecting opioid was 1.80 ± 3.32 years (range 0–26 years). Awareness and exposure to the act of injecting were amongst factors associated with perceived risk of transition to injecting (p < 0.01). On a univariate logistic regression analysis, less education was associated with increased likelihood while being employed was associated with less likelihood of being offered injection (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Though, NIOU are almost indistinguishable from PWID in many respects, there may be certain factors putting them at risk of transition to injecting route. As the majority of PWID start their injecting career by non-injecting route, interventions targeted atrisk NIOU (as suggested by our study) could interrupt the HIV transmission. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Heroin; HIV; Injecting drug use; Injection transition; Opioids,"National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses, New Delhi, India",English

In the last two decades there has been increasing focus on obtaining professional courses and degrees for employment in India. Aim: To understand the challenges faced by persons with severe mental illness with professional degrees in obtaining and maintaining employment. Methods: We interviewed 31 individuals with severe mental illness, who had professional degrees, using qualitative interviews. These interviews explored factors that facilitated as well as those that hindered the process of obtaining and sustaining jobs. Results: Factors that were identified as facilitators for obtaining and maintaining employment included personal strengths, social support, accommodative work environment, disclosure, support from mental health professionals and services. Factors that were identified as hindering for obtaining and maintaining employment included symptoms of the illness, side effects of medications, stigma, poor social support, academic underachievement, disjointed work history, poor workplace environment and specific cultural, gender issues. Conclusion: Factors such as workplace accommodations, creating an environment that is permissive of disclosure, using family support and support from mental health professionals will facilitate employment. Addressing factors that hinder such as stigma, academic under-achievement, improving workplace environments, social support will also be important in vocational recovery. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Professionals; Schizophrenia; Severe mental illness; Vocational challenges,"Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bangalore, 560029, India; Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bangalore, 560029, India; I/C Head of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services, Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bangalore, 560029, India",English

We aimed to investigate, with a cross-sectional study, the prevalence of disease categories, treatment methods, and disease status in patients from across different geographical areas and from countries with diverse wealth status. Methods: In this multinational, cross-sectional, observational cohort study, we asked international paediatric rheumatologists from specialised centres to enrol children with a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, according to International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria, who were seen consecutively for a period of 6 months. Each patient underwent retrospective and cross-sectional assessments, including measures of disease activity and damage and questionnaires on the wellbeing and quality of life of the children. We qualitatively compared the collected data across eight geographical areas, and we explored an association between disease activity and damage and a country's gross domestic product (GDP) with a multiple logistic regression analysis. Findings: Between April 4, 2011, and Nov 21, 2016, 9081 patients were enrolled at 130 centres in 49 countries, grouped into eight geographical areas. Systemic arthritis (125 [33·0%] of 379 patients) and enthesitis-related arthritis (113 [29·8%] of 379) were more common in southeast Asia, whereas oligoarthritis was more prevalent in southern Europe (1360 [56·7%] of 2400) and rheumatoid factor-negative polyarthritis was more frequent in North America (165 [31·5%] of 523) than in the other areas. Prevalence of uveitis was highest in northern Europe (161 [19·1%] of 845 patients) and southern Europe (450 [18·8%] of 2400) and lowest in Latin America (54 [6·4%] of 849), Africa and Middle East (71 [5·9%] of 1209), and southeast Asia (19 [5·0%] of 379). Median age at disease onset was lower in southern Europe (3·5 years, IQR 1·9–7·3) than in other regions. Biological, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were prescribed more frequently in northern Europe and North America than in other geographical settings. Patients living in countries with lower GDP had greater disease activity and damage than those living in wealthier countries. Damage was associated with referral delay. Interpretation: Our study documents a variability in prevalence of disease phenotypes and disparities in therapeutic choices and outcomes across geographical areas and wealth status of countries. The greater disease burden in lower-resource settings highlights the need for public health efforts aimed at improving equity in access to effective treatments and care for juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

"Chatterjee A., Gupta U., Chinnakotla M.K., Srikanth R., Galley M., Agrawal P.",Understanding Emotions in Text Using Deep Learning and Big Data,2019,Computers in Human Behavior,"Big Data and Deep Learning algorithms combined with enormous computing power have paved ways for significant technological advancements. Technology is evolving to anticipate, understand and address our unmet needs. However, to fully meet human needs, machines or computers must deeply understand human behavior including emotions. Emotions are physiological states generated in humans as a reaction to internal or external events. They are complex and studied across numerous fields including computer science. As humans, on reading “Why don't you ever text me!” we can either interpret it as a sad or an angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines as well. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. However, in today's online world, humans are increasingly communicating using text messaging applications and digital agents. Hence, it is imperative for machines to understand emotions in textual dialogue to provide emotionally aware responses to users. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Learning based approach to detect emotions - Happy, Sad and Angry in textual dialogues. The essence of our approach lies in combining both semantic and sentiment based representations for more accurate emotion detection. We use semi-automated techniques to gather large scale training data with diverse ways of expressing emotions to train our model. Evaluation of our approach on real world dialogue datasets reveals that it significantly outperforms traditional Machine Learning baselines as well as other off-the-shelf Deep Learning models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Chat bot; Cognitive computing; Conversational agent; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Long-short term memory; Structured semantics,"Microsoft, Hyderabad, India; Microsoft, Bellevue, United States; Microsoft Research, Redmond, United States",English

The current study focussed on a dendritic modification of PBA with hyperbranched polyglycerols (HPG) by Steglich esterification and further doping with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) of α-Fe 2 O 3 phase. The covalent coupling between HPG and PBA was confirmed by FTIR and 1 H-NMR spectra. The main objective of the study was to monitor the fluorescent properties of the modified and doped products. Steady state PL emission studies showed a considerable decrease in fluorescence intensity on HPG modification which almost completely disappeared on doping with IONP. This suggests that this fluorosensing property can be explored in identification and estimation of iron oxide nanoparticles which has a great significance in biomedical field both in diagnostics and therapeutics. Lifetime measurements with TCSPC suggested an aggregation enhanced quenching of HPG-PBA conjugates and mixed static and dynamic mechanisms in IONP doped HPG-PBA conjugates.

"Bhandarker A., Rai S.",Toxic leadership: emotional distress and coping strategy,2019,International Journal of Organization Theory and Behavior,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the distressing impact of toxic leadership on the mental state of the subordinates and examine the unique coping mechanisms used by them to deal with such leaders. The paper also examined the relationship between psychological distress and coping strategy used by subordinates to deal with the toxic leader. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a validity testing of two scales. The first scale was designed to measure experienced psychological distress emanating from exposure to toxic leaders, and the second scale aims to assess the coping strategies utilized by subordinates to deal with the toxic leaders. Data were collected from 570 employees working in public as well as private organizations in India. Findings: The results of this paper supported the theorized two three-dimensional tools to measure: psychological distress (loss of self-worth, withdrawal and agitated) and coping strategies to deal with toxic leaders (assertive coping, avoidance coping and adaptive coping). Reliability estimates and construct validity of both the tools were established. The results also suggest that the loss of self-worth was negatively related with assertive coping, avoidance coping and adaptive coping. However, withdrawal was positively related with assertive coping and avoidance coping. Finally, agitation was positively related with avoidance and adaptive coping. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the rare studies to examine together the phenomenon of both psychological distress experienced by subordinates and the coping strategies utilized by them to deal with toxic leaders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Psychological distress; Scale construction,"International Management Institute, New Delhi, India; Mettl, Gurugram, India",English

Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the proportion of heterosexual intimate partner relationships with a heavy drinking male that resulted in reported alcohol-related harm and to investigate the impact of this on well-being in 9 countries. Methods: This study used survey data from the Gender and Alcohol’s Harm to Others (GENAHTO) Project on Alcohol’s Harm to Others in 9 countries (10,613 female respondents, 7,091 with intimate live-in partners). Respondents were asked if their partners drinking had negatively affected them as well as questions on depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with life. Results: The proportion of partnered respondents that reported having a harmful heavy drinking partner varied across countries, from 4% in Nigeria and the US to 33% in Vietnam. The most consistent correlate of experiencing harm was being oneself a heavy episodic drinker, most likely as a proxy measure for the acceptability of alcohol consumption in social circles. Women with a harmful heavy drinking partner reported significantly lower mean satisfaction with life than those with a partner that did not drink heavily. Conclusions: Harms to women from heavy drinking intimate partners appear across a range of subgroups and impact on a wide range of women, at least demographically speaking. Women living with a heavy drinking spouse experience higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms and lower satisfaction with life. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Alcohol-related harm; cultural context; intimate partner; spouse,"Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Australia; Centre for Social Research on Alcohol & Drugs, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden; Centre for Public Health, National Institute of Mental Health and NeuroSciences, Bangalore, India; School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; International Health Policy Program (IHPP), Ministry of Public Health, Nonthaburi, Thailand; Alcohol Research Group, Public Health Institute, Emeryville, CA, United States; Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland; National Drug Research Institute, Curtin University, Perth, Australia",English

"Bhartia A., Vijayalakshmi V.",Does Emotional Social Competence Foster Team Climate?,2019,Psychological Studies,"People seldom leave an organisation, but they often leave because of the people in that organisation. Given the current context of multinational organisations and virtual teams, it is imperative to ensure a vibrant and positive team climate for employees that helps them thrive and deliver excellence. It is well established in the literature that among other factors, employees’ interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence and cultural competence significantly impact team climate. This study focuses on analysing the relationship between emotional social competence (ESC) and perceived team climate. The study draws from the self-determination theory which states individuals are responsible and intrinsically motivated. The development of a positive team climate has been looked upon primarily as a collective initiative. While it is important to focus on organisational aspects contributing to team climate, this study explores the individual competencies that contribute to the perception of a positive team climate. It employs structural equation modelling technique to study this relationship through data from a field study with 331 managers from manufacturing, banking and service industries. Results confirm that ESC clusters have a significant impact on the perceived team climate of the individuals. The practical implications of the study show that the organisations need to formulate developmental plans around individual competencies that have significant impact on building a positive team climate. © 2019, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Emotional intelligence; Emotional social competence; Positive emotions; Positive organisational behaviour; Team climate,"Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Sardar Patel Road, Guindy, Chennai, 600036, India",English
"Chandra P., Sharma A.","Subjectifying Construction: Situating Desire, Pleasure and Power in Heterosexual Relationships",2019,Psychological Studies,"This study attempts to understand the gender positions taken up by men and women with regard to desire, pleasure, and power in heterosexual relationships. This would require an insight into the developing sexual selves of the participants. Using the qualitative technique of discourse analysis, the focus was to cultivate an image of the sexual life of these young people such that one is able to see how the elements in the construction of their sexuality have coalesced resulting in the current positions. It became evident through an analysis of the narratives that women were very much aware of and exposed to the notions of desire and pleasure, and thought about their sexual nature and needs. They had no qualms in admitting and accepting the same. Among the men, it was seen that men were not uni-dimensional, single-minded and self-centred with regard to sex. Intimacy and emotionality were very much part of their sexual repertoire. With regard to the construct of power, it is evident from the narratives that there is a power dynamic at play where sexual experience could become a function of a feeling of superiority in heterosexual relationships. A power dynamic appears to exist between the forces of self and society as well and seems to be skewed in the favour of men. Thus, the focus here has not been to complete the jigsaw but to understand how these pieces have come to be a part of this puzzle, being completely aware that the results would only be an entry point into understanding how these complex structures develop. © 2019, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Desire; Gender; Pleasure; Power; Sexuality; Subjectivity,"Amity Institute of Psychology and Allied Studies, Amity University, Noida, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",English

Studies assessing public perceptions regarding mental illnesses are scarce in India. This study documents the stigma perceived by a rural population toward patients with mental illness and their families. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional pilot study was done in five villages, selected by simple random sampling, from a rural block in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Households in each village were selected by systematic random sampling. From the selected households, 150 subjects aged 18-65 years, without known mental disorders, were chosen by convenience sampling, based on availability. Stigma was assessed using the Devaluation of Consumers Scale (DCS) and Devaluation of Consumer's Families Scale (DCFS). Results: The proportion with high perceptions of stigma associated with mentally ill persons was 63.8%, among the 150 interviewed rural respondents (women: 112, median age: 37 years). The proportion which perceived that there was public stigma toward families of those with mental illnesses was 43.4%. Older respondents (>37 years) had higher perceptions of stigma (odds ratio: 2.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.20) than others. Conclusion: The high perception of stigma associated with persons who are mentally ill as well as their families needs to be kept in mind while planning interventions to decrease the treatment gap for psychiatric morbidity, especially in rural areas. © 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Mental illnesses; perception; stigma,"MBBS Students, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; Community Health Department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, 632 002, India",English

The Bipolar Depression Rating Scale (BDRS) was administered with the intervention and control groups that were equal at baseline. Meditation had a positive impact on the intervention group. Post intervention BDRS scores were significantly lower for patients from Asian cities, men, Hindus and Buddhists, middle class, and married patients as well as those who attended all the meditation rounds and regularly self-practiced. Within the BDRS outcome measure, depressive symptoms were impacted the most as compared with mixed symptoms. Meditation helped alleviate guilt, depressed mood, and helplessness–hopelessness. The meditation programme can be used as a combination therapy along with pharmacological treatment to treat mood instability and depression among patients with bipolar disorder II. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",bipolar disorder II; depression; meditation; mood instability,"School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English

However, this decision support system faces difficulties while dealing with sparse and noisy rating data. Therefore, this research re-classifies users and items of a system into three classes, namely strong, average and weak to identify and correct noise ratings. Later, the Bhattacharya coefficient, a well-performing similarity measure for a sparse dataset, is integrated with the proposed re-classification method to predict unrated items from the obtained noise-free sparse dataset and recommend preferred products to consumers. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed model is validated on two sparse and noisy datasets and compared with various published methods in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), F1-measure, precision, and recall values. The obtained results confirm that the proposed model performs better than other published relevant methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Collaborative filtering; Decision support systems; Natural noise; Recommender system; Sparsity,"Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India; Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University Montreal, Canada",English
"Banerjee P., Chatterjee P., Mishra S., Mishra A.A.","Loss is a loss, why categorize it? Mental accounting across cultures",2019,Journal of Consumer Behaviour,"Consumers regularly track their expenses and assign them to categories like food, entertainment, and clothing, which is popularly known as mental accounting. In this paper, we show that consumption biases that result from mental accounting—underconsumption or overconsumption—are not prevalent in Easterners due to their holistic thinking style, whereas Westerners exhibit such biases due to their analytic thinking style. In Study 1, we collected data with Easterners (students from the eastern part of India) and show that they do not exhibit mental accounting biases as is seen in Westerners. In Study 2, we show that such differences in mental accounting across cultures result from their thinking styles by manipulating thinking styles within a Western population (American students from the Midwest). We also show that the differences in styles of thinking across cultures motivate two different types of accounting processes—a piecemeal accounting process in the Westerners and a comprehensive accounting process in the Easterners—which in turn influence the differences in mental accounting biases across cultures. This finding adds to the growing literature in cross-cultural differences in consumer decision making and explores how and why a well-documented robust effect, mental accounting, varies with the cultural background of the consumers. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Marketing Management Area, Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, Kozhikode, Kerala, India; Spencer Fox Eccles Business Building, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States; Capitol Federal Hall, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States; Marketing Management Area, Goa Institute of Management, Goa, India",English

Research has focused on the absence or presence of mental health problems, such as depression, in caregivers. However, positive mental health – defined as the presence of positive emotions, psychological functioning, and social functioning – likely prevents depression and in caregivers may benefit children more than the mere absence of mental health problems. Little attention has been given to how caregivers sustain positive mental health, particularly when doing challenging work in impoverished settings. Objective: The study's objective was to determine what successful caregivers of orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC) in diverse countries do to sustain their positive mental health. Methods: Using a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study design, trained local interviewers recruited a convenience sample of OVC caregivers through residential care institutions from five geographic regions (Kenya; Ethiopia; Cambodia; Hyderabad, India; and Nagaland, India). Participants completed surveys and in-depth interviews about strategies used to sustain their mental health over time or improve it during challenging times. Results: Sixty-nine OVC caregivers from 28 residential care institutions participated. Positive mental health survey scores were high. We organized the strategies named into six categories ordered from most to least frequently named: Religious Practices; Engaging in Caregiving; Social Support; Pleasurable Activities; Emotion Regulation; and Removing Oneself from Work. Prayer and reading religious texts arose as common strategies. Participants reported promoting positive emotions by focusing on their work's meaning and playing with children. The similar findings across diverse regions were striking. Some differences included more emphasis on emotion control in Ethiopia; listening to music/singing in Kenya and Hyderabad; and involving children in the tasks the participants enjoyed less (e.g., cleaning) in Cambodia. Conclusions: Under real-world conditions, small daily activities appeared to help sustain positive mental health. In addition, fostering structures that allow caregivers to engage regularly in rewarding caregiving tasks may be an affordable and scalable idea which could potentially benefit caregivers, children, and employers. © 2018",Caregiving; Mental health; Occupational health; Orphaned and vulnerable children (OVC); Positive emotions; Spirituality,"Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research, Duke University, 310 Trent Drive, CB 90392, Durham, NC  27708, United States; Department of Sociology, Emory University, 1555 Dickey Dr., 225 Tarbutton Hall, Atlanta, GA  30322, United States; Department of Anthropology, Harvard University, Tozzer Anthropology Building, 21 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge MA 02138, Peabody Museum, 11 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA  02138, United States; Duke University Medical Center, Duke Divinity School, Box 90967, Durham, NC  27708, United States; Research Department, ACE Africa Kenya, P.O.

Obtaining contributions from external users, however, poses screening challenges in front of a firm, particularly when such contributions are enormously large in number. Therefore, this study attempts to help firms reduce their workload by examining the differences between adopted and non-adopted user innovations. Based on the prior research, we build a holistic research model by identifying four characteristics of a user innovation: innovation-related, innovator-related, presentation-related and rareness that may influence the evaluation process. The results of logistic regression on a publicly available dataset of 21,557 user innovations spanning five years collected from an online game UIC show that the popularity, integrity and maintenance of the innovation, as well as the prior adoption experience of the innovator, positively influence the adoption of a user innovation by the firm. Moreover, both the complexity of a user innovation and descriptive images have an inverted U-shaped relationship with the adopted innovation. Finally, adopted user innovations have high levels of rareness than non-adopted user innovations.

Chattopadhyay S.,The Responses of Health Systems to Marital Sexual Violence–A Perspective from Southern India,2019,"Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment and Trauma","Marital sexual violence is a serious problem in India. However, marital rape and most other forms of marital sexual violence are not criminalized in the country. This qualitative study with healthcare providers (physicians and nurses), lawyers, members of a non-profit organization that offers domestic violence support services out of a hospital, a journalist and two lawyers suggest that the majority of care providers recognize that marital sexual violence is a serious concern, and agree that health systems can play a vital role in addressing both the immediate biomedical concerns of survivors, and also overall well-being. The study reveals several systemic and internal factors that hinder responsiveness of Indian health institutions. These include, the absence of a protocol or uniform internal guidelines in most hospitals, a lack of screening programs to capture the presence of violence occurring when patients visit hospitals for other reasons, a large patient load, a lack of gender sensitivity in providers’ education, an absence of domestic violence shelters, and poor interlinkages between support services such as counseling and legal services. Notwithstanding these challenges, some exemplar physicians and nurses assist survivors of sexual violence, sometimes risking their own safety. The Indian health system can be made more responsive, provided these factors are addressed, and crucially budgets are allocated for interventions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Domestic violence; feminism; gender; health systems; India; interventions; law; marital rape; sexual violence,"School of Advanced Studies and Research, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore, India; Public Health Foundation of India, India",English
"Paplikar A., Mekala S., Bak T.H., Dharamkar S., Alladi S., Kaul S.",Bilingualism and the severity of poststroke aphasia,2019,Aphasiology,"Background: Bilingualism has been associated with cognitive benefits in healthy people as well as in patients with cognitive impairment due to stroke and dementia. However, the relationship between bilingualism and aphasia is more complex. While bilinguals are as likely as monolinguals to develop aphasia after stroke, studies of relationship between bilingualism and severity of poststroke language recovery are few and have produced conflicting results, with much evidence derived from immigrant populations or small case series. Aims: Against this background of limited number of studies, we set out to explore the relationship between bilingualism and severity of language impairment in stroke aphasia. We explored the hypothesis that enhanced cognitive abilities related to bilingualism may have a positive impact on recovery from aphasia. Methods & Procedures: We investigated 38 bilingual and 27 monolingual patients who participated in a longitudinal hospital-based stroke registry and were evaluated at least 3 months after stroke (mean 11.5 months). Patient performance on language and other cognitive functions was evaluated with Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination–Revised (ACE-R) validated for use in aphasia in local languages and for varying educational levels. The results of monolinguals and bilinguals were compared after accounting for confounding variables, including age, gender, education, occupation, medical, and stroke characteristics. Outcomes & Results: Aphasia severity as measured by the language domain sub-scores (total of language and fluency scores) of ACE-R was significantly higher in monolinguals compared with bilinguals (7.0 vs. 14.4, maximum score 40; p = 0.008, effect size = −0.691). Bilinguals performed significantly better than their monolingual counterparts in attention, memory, and visuospatial domains of ACE-R. A univariate general linear model analysis showed that bilingualism was significantly associated with higher language domain scores of ACE-R after adjusting for other confounding variables. Conclusions: The results suggest that although bilingual speakers are at equal risk of developing aphasia after stroke as monolingual ones, their aphasia is likely to be less severe. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Padhi S.K.,Gene editing in plants,2019,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"Gene editing or genome editing is a type of genetic engineering in which the DNA is introduced, deleted, modified or replaced into the genome of a living organism. It is the deliberate alteration of a selected DNA sequence in a living cell. In this, a strand of DNA is cut by using the molecular scissors at a specific point and the broken DNA strands are fixed together with the help of DNA ligase by naturally existing cellular repair mechanism. It was first accomplished by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1972. It is an important technology for making changes in DNA, which includes the changes in physical traits such as eye color or risk of any disease. Genome / gene editing using Engineered Endonuclease (GEEN) systems have been well established over the fields of plant biotechnology. Till now, gene editing have been implicated in various different plants such as Arabidopsis including the main crops like rice, wheat and maize and some less important crops such as strawberry, cucumber, etc. To improve the safety of food, the research in plant biology aims at improving the yield of crops and various other factors such as biotic and abiotic stress, along with the enhancement in the nutritional content of food. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

Dash P.,Overview on challenges faced by SME’s,2019,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"The pace of advancement keeps on expanding in the developed world as well as likewise in developed markets. The key issue confronting numerous “small medium-sized enterprises” is identified with how they can encourage powerful development. Development in “small medium-sized enterprises” can be (increasingly) productive and powerful; be that as it may, this isn't the situation in numerous “small medium-sized enterprises”. Modern and management ventures with under 50 workers, due to their size and asset constraints, they can't grow new innovations or to roll out indispensable improvements in the current ones. The point of this investigation is to recognize the most significant difficulties of “small and medium enterprises” in exploitation of advancement openings. It utilized the exploratory factor investigation which exhibited the accompanying six difficulties in the request for significance: administrative and human asset; look into furthermore, improvement; innovations, national arrangement and administrative condition and need of market data. “Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)” are the foundation of the economy. They make up over 98% of every single business that give two out of three private segment occupations in the area. In this manner, it is essentially significant for monetary accomplishment to have completely working help measures for “small medium-sized enterprises”. Notwithstanding, “small medium-sized enterprises” face difficulties from constrained access to back, absence of databases, low R&D consumptions, lacking deals channels, what's more, low degrees of money related incorporation, which are a portion of the explanations for the moderate development of “small medium-sized enterprises”. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

"Pradhan B.B., Behera S.K.",Effects of agrochemicals on human health,2019,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"The industrialization of agricultural segment has increased the chemical pressure on natural ecosystems. Nowadays, agrochemicals are commonly used in food production. Pesticides are agrochemicals used to protect plants and humans from various diseases in urban green areas, agricultural land and public health programs. Farmers use agrochemicals to monitor weed growth and to prevent insects, moulds and rodents from destroying crops. The extreme use of agrochemicals has led to growing concerns about the adverse effects on environment and the human health. The continued use of agrochemicals against disease vectors and agricultural pests presents serious threats to human health as well as the environment. The periods and levels of exposure to agrochemicals, the types of agrochemicals used (in terms of toxicity and persistence) and the different environmental conditions of the areas are also some of the factors for acute and chronic human health and environmental poisoning. Farmers should use alternative methods such as integrated pest management (IPM), organic farming or crop rotation to avoid contamination of foods with agrochemicals. Consumers should also have organic food products in order to get away from the harmful effects of agrochemicals. However, their side effects can be an important factor in environmental health risk because of their known ability to cause a large number of negative environmental and health effects. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

"Mohanty S., Dash S.",Effect of fertilizers and pesticides application on soil microbiota,2019,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"Soil health management is vital to guarantee production of sustainable agriculture and biodiversity maintenance. Modern farming relies primarily on the extensive use of agrochemicals, including inorganic pesticides and fertilizers. Arbitrary, long-term and over-use of pesticides has serious effects on soil ecology that can lead to changes in or degradation of valuable or crop probiotic soil microbiota. For industrial agriculture, pesticides and fertilizers are a necessary evil. In addition to a number of broadly discussed and well-known harmful effects on the human health and environment of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, they were also held responsible for strongly affecting soil microbial properties. Soil microbiota is a key component of agricultural ecosystems, which not only plays an important role in basic soil processes, but also actively participates in improving the productivity of crop and soil fertility. Pesticides and fertilizers continue to remain in the soil for a long time so they are expected to affect the micobiota of the soil and thus disturbing the health of the soil. This study reviews the effect of long-term use of pesticides and fertilizers on cultivated soil microbiota with respect to fertility and soil health. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

Padhi S.K.,Altering colors of transgenic flowers by RNAi-mediated method,2019,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"Flower color is one of the most significant characteristics of ornamental plants. Several internal and external factors influence its growth and development. Consequently, the understanding and control of the color production process is an important theoretical basis and principle in developing and improving new ornamental plant color varieties. The essential cut-flower crop-carnation, genetically modified, color-altered varieties are now available commercially for almost a decade. The major cut-flower plant carnations are now commercially available for almost ten years as genetically modified, color-altered varieties. The phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi), which results in translational inhibition or transcriptional repression, has a role in sequence-specific gene regulation regulated by the introduction of dsRNA. Since, RNAi has been discovered and regulatory potential, the potential of RNAi to open a new view on agricultural improvement has become apparent.The biosynthetic pathway and pathway in which the genes are involved are so well characterized that the change in flower color can be affected by over-expressing heterologous genes and suppressing endogenous genes in transgenic plants. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

The existence of crops residue is an important element of management under consideration, because it represents an overwhelming amount of organic matter that can be retained in or extracted from the agriculture-ecosystem. It is important to address the effect of crop residues management on the agriculture-ecosystem linked to local climatic conditions.Crop residues, contains huge amounts of assimilated C and minerals such as NPK (nitrogen, phospohorus, potassium) that should undergo process of recycling for developing sustainable agriculture. The management of crop residues is required to serve a dual purpose, both in the face of global warming as well as food security through increased carbon sequestration. In this study, especial focus is given on the major challenges faced by agriculture sectors, the factors affecting high productivity, surplus crop density, harmful effects related to the wastage of crops, effect of temperature on crop residues, in-situ incorporation, and management techniques like water saving, increasing crop productivity, and recommendations for managing crop residues. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

"Behera S.K., Nanda S.",Weed management in organic farming,2019,International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation,"Weeds are one of the key obstacles for sustaining the productivity of the crop. Weeds fight with crops for soil moisture, nutrients, space, and solar radiation; and decrease the quality and yield of produce. In addition, they also act as an alternative host for disease-causing microorganisms and insect-pests. Problems with weeds vary in various seasons, crops, management practices, and agro-ecological conditions. Various methods of weed control in field crops are used with varying degrees of success, including preventive, chemical biological, cultural, mechanical and biotechnological approaches. Chemical intervention in organic farming systems is not permitted because of the lack of research on non-chemical weed management options has made weeds serious trouble in organic farming. It is important to understand that weeds will never be eliminated under an organic scheme, but will only be managed. In organic systems, weed control focuses on management techniques that are designed to prevent weeds, as well as crop production that is large enough to out-compete weeds and reduce the availability of weed resources. In organic farming, the main target of weed management is to bring about substantial yield improvement of the crop and to decrease the degree of direct control inputs. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

Acharya A.,Factors behind dissuasion to green products among young consumers: A qualitative study,2019,Qualitative Report,"The current estimated market share for green consumption is less than five percent worldwide, therefore it is very important to understand the factors that stimulate non green consumption among young consumers since this can promote environmental thinking at an early age and also to increase the demand for green products. In these circumstances, emerging countries like India have contributed very less to the consumption of green products and environmental effects. India is among the fastest growing economies in the world. With the increase in population as well as in disposable income, India is expected to see a growth in green consumption. However, that does not seem to be the case. Although, consumption of products is widely prevalent in India and has been growing steadily over the years, the same is not seen with regards to green products in particular. The present paper attempts to investigate the factors for less consumption of green products in the emerging market of India. 31 college students aged 21-25 years participated in the study. An unstructured interview technique was employed to find out the reasons for less consumption of green products among young Indian consumers. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Four main themes namely incomprehension, extortionate, limited product range and non-availability emerged out of the study.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Data was gathered through interviews with University students. The concept mapping tool was employed to analyse it. Findings: Findings lead to some new intrinsic motives that drive youth to view online television such as time fillers, refreshments, boredom, relaxation, improvement in vocabulary, improved communication skills, entertainment, companionship, control, possibility to skip advertisements, learning platform, etc. Its over-consumption however, is leading to addiction which in turn, is hampering their sleep, studies and family relations. Research limitations: The current study is limited to youth. Further research may be carried out to identify motives of school going students, middle aged and elders behind online television consumption and how it is impacting them. Social Implications: The findings have significant implications for youth as well as society. Originality/Value: With the proliferation in mobile devices and increasing internet penetration online media consumption is becoming more popular among young consumers. Online television is a new concept in India. Therefore, much remains to be explored about this phenomenon in terms of consumer motives and its resulting outcomes.

To date, most research have been quantitative and survey-based. This study qualitatively examined the components model of addiction for both “addicted” and “non-addicted” users. Methods: A screening tool comprising 10 dichotomous items was administered to 40 college students. Of these, six addicted and six non-addicted participants were identified on the basis of their score on the screening tool and were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview. The interview questions were based on the components model of addiction comprising six domains (i.e., salience, withdrawal, conflict, relapse and reinstatement, tolerance, and mood modification). Directed content analysis was used to analyze the transcribed data and subthemes as well as emerging themes for the study as a whole were established. Results: There was some evidence of demarcation between smartphone addicts on the dimensions of salience, tolerance, withdrawal, and conflict. Mood modification was not much different in either group, and no participant reported relapse. Conclusions: The non-addicted group had much greater control over their smartphone usage than the addicted group on four (of six) aforementioned dimensions of behavioral addiction. Consequently, the main findings of this study provided good support for the components model of behavioral addiction. © 2019 The Author(s)",Behavioral addiction; Component model; Contextual factors; Directed content analysis; Smartphone addiction; Social factors,"Faculty of Behavioral Sciences, SGT University, Gurugram, India; Department of Psychology, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India; Psychology Department, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom",English

It is, hence, ambivalent by being an expression of artistic freedom as well as a humorous comment on history where the axis of representation intersects the axis of history. The representation of the Dalit icon, Ambedkar, was objectionable to the political party espousing the Dalit cause which, through its leader, Tirumavalavan, raised the issue in parliament. The paper posits that the reaction was an event that was hitherto dormant and that it erupted on account of elements that fed its potential for virality in the environment, thereby, turning it into a fact. To this end, the paper revives interest in the imitation theory of the French sociologist, Gabriel Tarde, who, incidentally, was an intellectual influence on Ambedkar. Moreover, it employs Zeno Vendler's distinction between an ""event"" and a ""fact"", the Deleuzian idea of ""assemblage,"" and the idea of ""conceptual metaphor"" as laid out by Lakoff and Johnson. The paper reads the vicissitudes of the cartoon in order to theorize the elements that cause virality in a communicative environment. © Cracow Tertium Society for the Promotion of Language Studies.",Ambivalence; Event; Historical axis; Imitation; Metaphor; Representational axis,"National Institute of Technology, India",English

In today's knowledge society, the amount of scientific-applied information, which university graduates have to acquire, continues to increase continuously. There is a concurrent reduction in the number of study hours to undertake educational programmes in order to increase the hours for students' independent work. Against this background, higher school is required to increase future experts' competencies. Therefore, the content of fundamental and special disciplines of entire period of training and independent work of students should be thoroughly coordinated by increasing students' motivation to self-education and self-development. Classroom-based and independent learning of disciplines and sections of fundamental academic courses, especially chemistry, is impossible without formation of students' scientific thinking. Today, it is difficult to consider the activity of most professionals without the ability to think scientifically: active expansion of science into professional sphere has a strong tendency to be increased. The aim of the present research is to show the possibilities of formation and development of scientific thinking in the students of natural-scientific and technical directions of education using the example of studying of one of the elements of programmes in chemistry (the method of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis). Methodology and research methods. The research was carried out on the basis of competency-based, systematic and interdisciplinary approaches. The methods of analysis, synthesis, integration, differentiation and compactification of fundamental knowledge and training material were used. Results and scientific novelty. The high potential of chemical education for formation of scientific thinking, subject content (chemical), natural-scientific and holistic scientific thinking is emphasised. However, chemistry education in higher education institution is complicated by the absence of the unified structure of fundamental preparation, the preservation of extensive approach to the content of chemical disciplines, the irrational organisation of students' independent work, which now is accounted for a half of instructional time. Overcoming these problems lies in the dialectic unity of fundamental and practice-oriented knowledge, which is provided by the compliance with the principles of continuity and interdisciplinarity. It is necessary to provide deductive structurisation of training material in order to give integrity and systemacity to the content of education, without which it is impossible to create a comprehensive natural-scientific picture of the world in students. The key initial element of vocational training stimulating the formation of reflexive skills and scientific thinking of future experts is mastering by students of a categorical-conceptual framework of science, which is consistently and comprehensively revealed throughout a high school stage of education. The authors designated phases of development of scientific thinking (formal-logical, reflexive-theoretical, hypothetico-deductive thinking), which are not clearly differentiated due to interpenetration and entanglement of their components and identity of thought processes in terms of their speed and quality. However, the allocation of these stages allows to structure and to correct the content of educational material taking into account the characteristics and the level of students' readiness. From these standpoints, the expediency of more detailed examination of the NMR method is proved within the disciplines such as “Chemistry”, “General Chemistry”, “Inorganic Chemistry” and “Analytical Chemistry” (a part of material about the NMR method can be worked out by students independently). This method, based on one phenomenon, includes hundreds of various types of the experiments, which are intended for receiving particular information. The NMR method is widely used both in scientific research, including master's thesis, and in the most various manufacturing spheres. Today, the spectroscopy of NMR is recognised as the most powerful informative and perspective method of structural analysis of substance. The fundamental nature, interdisciplinarity and universality of the method provide students with basic professional knowledge on physics, chemistry, medicine, biology, technology and ecology. The authors of the present research propose the option of configuration of educational information on NMR. According to the suggested version, the principle of work is the following: firstly, bachelors study the system of key concepts and terms, moving gradually from formal-logical to substantial generalisations; then, students learn to explain the phenomena scientifically and to make forecasts, and, as a result, they become the “owners” of hypothetico-deductive thinking. The acquired competencies are the key to professional literacy, which is improved in master's degree programme, when the previously compactified scientific knowledge in a contracted form is developed in the form suitable for an optimal solution of a particular research or practical aim. The similar scheme of vocational training makes it possible to overcome traditional orientation of high school programmes of the natural-science block (i.e. retention of permanently growing amount of factual material). Practical significance. The research materials can be useful for methodologists of the higher school, for experts engaged in methodological development and the organisation of educational process, for high school teachers of chemistry and related disciplines, for post-graduate students and master's students of chemical and chemico-technological specialties as well. © 2019 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

"Thomas T., Sunny M.M.",Situational determinants of hand-proximity effects,2019,Collabra: Psychology,"Recent studies have demonstrated altered visual processing of stimuli in the proximal region of the hand. It has been challenging to characterize the range and nature of these processing differences. In our attempt to deconstruct the factors giving rise to the Hand-Proximity Effects (HPEs), we manipulated the organization of items in a visual search display. In two experiments, we observed the absence of HPE. Specifically, in Experiment 1, we presented the search display in only one half of the monitor (split diagonally), which could be either near or far from the hand placed on the corner of the monitor. The results of a Bayesian analysis showed that the search efficiency was not significantly different for neither ‘near’ nor ‘far’ condition when compared with the baseline condition in which the hand rested on the lap. In Experiment 2, the search display was arranged horizontally across the monitor. A Bayesian analysis showed that RTs did not vary depending on the proximity of the target to the hand as well as the baseline (lap) condition. The present results characterize features of the HPE that have not been reported previously and are in line with recent reports of the failure to replicate HPE under various circumstances. © 2019 The Author(s).",Altered vision near hands; Attentional disengagement; Hand-proximity; Spatial prioritization; Visual search,"Centre for Cognitive Science, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gandhinagar, India",English
"Shashi Kiran Reddy J., Roy S.",Understanding meditation based on the subjective experience and traditional goal: Implications for current meditation research,2019,Frontiers in Psychology,"Owing to its benefits on various cognitive aspects, one’s emotions, and well-being, meditation has drawn interest from several researchers and common public alike. We have different meditation practices associated with many cultures and traditions across the globe. Current literature suggests significant changes in the neural activity among the different practices of meditation, as each of these practices contributes to distinct physiological and psychological effects. Although this is the case, we want to find out if there is an underlying commonality among all these different practices. Thus, we ask the following questions related to different practices of meditation, the traditional goal of meditation and its significance—what is the central purpose of meditation? Do traditions define the final goal of all the practices of meditation? Are the purpose and goal of these practices different or is there a common goal to be attained through all these distinct practices? Embracing the traditional perspective, through this paper, we want to emphasize that, although these techniques and practices may appear different on the periphery, eventually, they seem to subject one to the same experience at the end, a natural meditative state (discussed in various spiritual traditions as the goal of meditation). In view of future studies on different meditation practices and also those exploring this subjective state, we offer some interesting ideas based on the traditional insights into meditation. In this context, we would also like to make a few comments on the way contemporary researchers view different practices of meditation. © 2019 Reddy and Roy.",Meditation; Meditative state; Neural oscillations; Pure consciousness; States of consciousness; Subjective experience; Turiya,"National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Campus, Bangalore, India",English
"Chauhan H.Y., Pai K.K.",Two birds with one stone: How depression and distress in diabetes respond to antidepressants,2019,Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy,"Aim of the study: As with other chronic diseases, depression is more prevalent among the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Depression and diabetes-related distress adversely affect diabetes-related outcomes. This study aims at identifying comprehensive effects of antidepressant treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and co-morbid depression. Material and methods: 124 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 (PHQ-9). 34 subjects with PHQ score > 10 were recruited to the study and rated on Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS). Subjects’ glycemic parameters – Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), Post-Pran-dial Blood Sugar (PPBS) and Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) were recorded. All subjects were treated with either escitalopram or mirtazapine for a period of 8 weeks. Post-intervention changes in BDI, MADRS, DDS and glycemic parameters were noted. Results: Antidepressant treatment has led to a significant improvement in depressive symptoms (reduction in BDI: 19.13 ± 8.06; reduction in MADRS: 17.16 ± 5.3) and diabetes-related distress (reduction in DDS: 17.81 ± 8.93). Significant improvements were also noticed in glycemic parameters: FBS (p= 0.015) and HbA1C (p=0.004). Discussion: Distress in diabetes leads to poor self-care and higher HbA1C, while depression predicts poorer glycemic control, more complications and higher health-care costs. Improvement in depression and distress in diabetes yields much greater benefits. Conclusions: Antidepressant treatment with escitalopram or mirtazapine can effectively treat depression and reduce diabetes-related distress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Beneficial effects are noted on glycemic parameters as well. © 2019 Polish Psychiatric Association.

A personal survey method was employed for data collection using standardized measures from a representative sample of 433 managers (201 women and 233 men) from private sector companies in India. The findings revealed that perceived gender equity in the workplace positively impacts employee well-being for both men and women, with the greater impact being on women's well-being. To Facilitate employee well-being, organizations can leverage the strengths of psychological capital through training interventions and can promote perceived gender equity through appropriate policies and practices. This bridges the knowledge gap in developing and utilizing psychological capital to enhance employee well-being, especially for women, who are under pressure due to their demanding multiple roles at work and home. © 2019 Chawla and Sharma.",Commitment; Gender equity; Indian study; Psychological capital; Social support; Well-being; Women's well-being,"Organizational Behavior, Management Development Institute, Gurgaon, India",English

Om mantra chanting, a simple and easy to practice, also comes under the aspect of meditation. The “Om” mantra is also considered as the very name of the absolute. Om meditation not only affects the various parts of the brain, such as pre-frontal cortex, vagus nerve, amygdala and others but also affects the heart rate and respiratory rate. Considering the healing effects of Om meditation, through this paper, we are trying to explore all the relevant work done in the field of Om meditation. The survey includes a large number of papers covering the research previously conducted by many researchers, their results and different techniques adopted to study the effect of Om meditation on human beings. Studies on Om meditation are categorized under four different heads: Neuroimaging studies, EEG studies, evoked potentials studies and other methods studies. Even though the existing research evidenced capability of Om meditation in curing anxiety and depression, more rigorous studies with better design, with larger sample size and with different control groups are required. Especially the need to explore untouched research areas of Loud Om meditation using EEG is suggested in the paper. Furthermore, future research directions are also suggested. © 2019, PsychOpen.

"Krishna G., Hosamani R., Muralidhara",Bacopa monnieri supplements offset paraquat-induced behavioral phenotype and brain oxidative pathways in mice,2019,Central Nervous System Agents in Medicinal Chemistry,"Background: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is characterized by alterations in cerebellum and basal ganglia functioning with corresponding motor deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Involvement of oxidative dysfunction has been implicated for the progression of PD, and environmental neurotoxin exposure could influence such behavior and psychiatric pathology. Assessing dietary supplementation strategies with naturally occurring phytochemicals to reduce behavioral anomalies associated with neurotoxin exposure would have major clinical importance. The present investigation assessed the influence of Bacopa monneri (BM) on behaviors considered to reflect anxiety-like state and motor function as well as selected biochemical changes in brain regions of mice chronically exposed to ecologically relevant herbicide, paraquat (PQ). Materials & Methods: Male mice (4-week old, Swiss) were daily provided with oral supplements of standardized BM extract (200 mg/kg body weight/day; 3 weeks) and PQ (10 mg/kg, i.p. three times a week; 3 weeks). Results: We found that BM supplementation significantly reversed the PQ-induced reduction of exploratory behavior, gait abnormalities (stride length and mismatch of paw placement) and motor impairment (rotarod performance). In a separate study, BM administration prevented the reduction in dopamine levels and reversed cholinergic activity in brain regions important for motor (striatum) pathology. Further, in mitochondria, PQ-induced decrease in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity and energy charge (MTT reduction), was restored with BM supplementation. Conclusion: These findings suggest that BM supplementation mitigates paraquat-induced behavioral deficits and brain oxidative stress in mice. However, further investigations would enable us to identify specific molecular mechanism by which BM influences behavioural pathology. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",Bacopa monnieri; Behavior; Oxidative stress; Paraquat; Parkinson’s disease; Phytochemicals,"Department of Child Health, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ  85004, United States; Department of Biochemistry, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore, Karnataka, India",English

It also examines the social and personality factors that predict subjective well-being among millennials in India. One thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine millennials, aged 16–27, attending technical educational institutions in India, participated. Four components assessed subjective well-being. Factual and subjective indicators of income, education, health, and relationships were measured. An inventory assessed Big-Five personality factors. The hierarchical structure, having interrelated components, formed subjective well-being better than other structures. The most important positive social predictor of the hierarchical structure of subjective well-being was satisfaction with personal relationships and the personality predictor was emotional stability.

Materials and methods: A 17 item questionnaire, requiring about 5–6 minutes for completion was used to carry out the survey. Results: Out of the 1300 Residents currently working in the institute, 442 (32%) Residents participated in the survey. Most of the participants were post-graduate trainees. In terms of level of stress related to the work/workplace, moderate and severe stress was perceived by 42.8% and 39.1% of respondents. The stress was attributed mainly to long working hours (66.2%), lack of off-days (52.3%), poor work environment (35.4%) and academic pressure (41.3%). Nearly three-fourths of the respondents considered that the stress was taking a toll on their physical as well as mental health. However, only about 13% had sought help from mental health professionals within or outside the institute. The main barriers reported for not seeking help from mental health professionals included stigma of being labeled as mentally ill (54.6%), being labeled as weak amongst their peers (58.1%) and lack of time to seek consultation among others (43.1%). Conclusions: Trainee doctors face significant levels of stress during their training program. However, few seek help.

Various approaches have tried to explain the intricacies in depression and suicide, as a consequence of faulty psychological adjustment of the individual. Several therapeutic approaches have been developed to strengthen one's coping process, among which cognitive behaviour therapy has shown promising results. Also, mindfulness-based approaches to cognitive behavioural therapy have further accelerated the well-being of such individuals. This study was conducted with an aim to see the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy on life satisfaction and life orientation in adolescents with depression and suicidal behaviour. A sample of 30 adolescents who scored high on scales of depression and suicidal tendencies were administered pre-test measures on life satisfaction and life orientation. After that they were exposed to an eight weeks programme on mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy, followed by a post-assessment on the same measures. The analysis of pre and post test revealed a significant enhancement in life satisfaction, life orientation, and family functioning as well as a reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. It is concluded that mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy serves as an effective medium to enhance the psychological functioning of depressive and suicidal adolescents. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Department of Psychology, R.D.S.

Swaminathan S.,Nothing ‘Mere’ to It: Reclaiming Subjective Accounts of Normativity of Law,2019,Journal of Human Values,"If the bindingness of morality was to rest on something as ‘subjective’ as the non-cognitivist says it does, the grouse goes, and morality itself would come down crashing. Nothing less than an ‘objective’ (response-independent) source of normativity, it is supposed, could hold morality in orbit. Some of these worries automatically morph into worries about the projectivist model of normativity of law (based on a non-cognitivist meta-ethic) as well: one which understands the authority or normativity of law in terms of subjective attitudes taken towards the law. As well as the stock worries about non-cognitivism, there are some additional ones that the projectivist model brings in its wake that it cannot account for the ‘uniform’ bindingness of law and that a subjective source of normativity of law based on mental states is unintelligible. This essay makes the case for acquitting the projectivist model of normativity of law from the above charges. But the route to that necessarily leads through first acquitting the non-cognitivist model of moral bindingness from analogous charges. © 2019 SAGE Publications.",bindingness; Friedrich Nietzsche; H.

"Yamamiya Y., Shroff H., Schaefer L.M., Thompson J.K., Shimai S., Ordaz D.L.",An exploration of the psychometric properties of the SATAQ-4 among adolescent boys in Japan,2019,Eating Behaviors,"Research among Western adult and adolescent males suggests that sociocultural influences are implicated in the drive for muscularity and weight-change behaviors. However, few studies have examined these relationships among adolescent boys from non-Western backgrounds. The current study sought to assess the psychometric properties of the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 (SATAQ-4), a 22-item, 5-factor measure of sociocultural influence on appearance ideals, among Japanese (n = 984) adolescent boys. Relationships between appearance-related pressures, appearance ideal internalization, appearance-related teasing, drive for muscularity, and weight-change behaviors were also assessed. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified a four factor solution (Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures: Media, and Pressures: Family/Peers) with 16 items in this sample. Correlational analyses supported the construct validity of the SATAQ-4. Thin internalization was associated with strategies to lose weight, while muscular internalization was associated with drive for muscularity and strategies to gain weight. Further, peer and parental appearance teasing was associated with perceived appearance pressures from family and peers, as well as weight change strategies. Overall, results suggested modification of the SATAQ-4 when used with Japanese samples, but supported its use to assess sociocultural influences. Additionally, the results highlight that sociocultural influences and muscularity concerns among Japanese adolescent boys are associated in similar ways with weight change strategies as has been established for adolescent males in Western countries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Temple University Japan Campus, Tokyo, Japan; School of Health Systems Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India; Sanford Center for Behavioral Research, Fargo, ND, United States; Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States; Kansai University of Welfare Sciences, Osaka, Japan",English

Adequately powered studies to evaluate the effect of such symptoms in the course of the disorder, are few. Aim: We aimed to estimate the prevalence and type of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in persons with schizophrenia. Methods: We evaluated 200 outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-V) on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). Participants with or without obsessive compulsive symptoms were matched on age, gender and age of onset of schizophrenia. Appropriate analysis by comparisons and correlations were performed. Results: Prevalence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was 18.5% (n = 37/200). Most common obsession was contamination and compulsion was cleaning/washing with a prevalence of 51.35% and 63.33% respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups on age, gender, marital status, residence, age of onset or total duration of illness of schizophrenia. The OC symptoms group had significantly higher general psychopathology and PANSS total scores. There was significant positive correlation between YBOCS total obsession scores (To) and total PANSS scores (r = 0.358) (p = 0.030), as well as PANSS general psychopathology subscale scores (Gt) (r = 0.395) (p = 0.016) and finally between total YBOCS scores (To + Tc) and PANSS positive subscale scores (Pt)(r = 0.344) (p = 0.037). Conclusion: There was a significant subgroup of schizophrenia patients (almost one fifth) who complained of obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

The DRD2 (Taq1 A-B-D) and 5-HT2 A (rs6311-rs6313-rs6305) haplotype frequencies differed significantly for A2B1D2 [p = 0.038; OR = 0.685 (95%CI = 0.479–0.981)] and ACC [p = 0.001; OR = 0.621 (95%CI = 0.461-0.838)] for the cases vs genetically related healthy controls. Similarly, significant difference was observed for the frequencies of GCC [p = 0.006; OR = 0.692 (95%CI = 0.532–0.900)] and ACC [p < 0.001; OR = 3.622 (95%CI = 1.73–7.585)] in the cases and unrelated healthy controls. Unlike previous research from India as well as abroad, the predominance of B1 allele of rs1079597 in patients with schizophrenia and absence of Cys311 in all study participants is a salient difference. Concluding, the B2 allele of rs1079597 may increase the risk of schizophrenia while the A2B1D2 haplotype may be protective in North Indian population. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",5-HT2; DRD2; Genetic association; Schizophrenia,"Department of Physiology, Government Medical College & Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, India; Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College & Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, India; Genetic Centre, Government Medical College & Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh, India; Department of Biochemistry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Sector 12, Chandigarh, India; Department of Psychiatry, King George's Medical University, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India; Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Amritsar, Punjab, India; Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, India; Department of Psychiatry, SMS Medical College, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India; Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India",English

Restricting access to pesticides at a local level is one strategy to address this major public health problem, but little is known about its effectiveness. We therefore conducted a systematic literature review to identify effective community-based suicide prevention approaches that involve restricting access to pesticides. Method: We searched Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PubMed for well-designed studies that reported on suicide-related outcomes (i.e., attempted or completed suicide). Results: We identified only five studies that met our eligibility criteria (two randomized controlled trials, two studies with quasi-experimental designs, and one study with a before-and-after design). These studies tested different interventions: the introduction of nonpesticide agricultural management, providing central storage facilities for pesticides, distributing locked storage containers to households, and local insecticide bans. The only sufficiently powered study produced no evidence of the effectiveness of providing household storage containers. Three interventions showed some promise in reducing pesticide suicides or attempts, with certain caveats. Conclusions: Our review identified three community interventions that show some promise for reducing pesticide suicides by restricting access to means, which will require replication in large, well-designed trials before they can be recommended. © 2018 The American Association of Suicidology",,"Centre for Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Department of Psychology, Centre for Research and Intervention on Suicide, Ethical Issues and End of Life Practices, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Centre for Research and Intervention on Suicide, Ethical Issues and End of Life Practices, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Sneha, Voluntary Health Services, Chennai, India; Suicide Research and Prevention Center, Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China",English

"Vaishnavi J., Kumar A.",Parental Involvement in School Counseling Services: Challenges and Experience of Counselor,2018,Psychological Studies,"School counselors include parents as informants in school counseling for various reasons like for consultation and client’s intervention which could lead to a different experience. The objective of the present study was to explore the challenges faced by school counselors when involving parents in the school counseling process and the ways they handle the challenges. The participants consisted of seven school counselors, with whom in-depth interviews were conducted. The subjective experiences of the school counselors were objectively interpreted by the researcher using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The research results were categorized into master and subordinate themes using double hermeneutics. The results revealed that although school counselors have their own individual perceptions of challenges and methods of handling parental inclusion in the school counseling context, there still exist similarities in their methods of handling. The study highlights school counselors’ beliefs about parents’ perceptions and expectations of counseling as well as parents’ reaction toward their child’s problem as a challenge. The findings throw light on the need for stronger evidence-based practices and policies for school counseling programs. Training and competence-building programs for school counselors would improve the service delivery. © 2018, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Parents; School counseling; School counselor experience,"Department of Psychology, Christ University, Bengaluru, India",English
"Aggarwal P., Sriram S.",Exploring Well-Being among Mental Health Professionals in India,2018,Psychological Studies,"An exploratory mixed methods study was designed to understand the construction and experience of happiness and well-being among Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) in India. Through non-probabilistic sampling techniques, 17 MHPs were selected from three government hospitals in a city in North India. Qualitative interview data were triangulated with scores from the Mental Health Continuum-Long Form (MHC-LF). Analysis showed that despite happiness being a desirable and pleasurable state, participants rarely devoted time thinking about it. Happiness was a multidimensional phenomenon which affected personal, interpersonal, social and environmental realms. Happiness was synonymous with contentment and satisfaction and was understood as the opposite of unhappiness. Although recognised as a universal phenomenon, happiness had a subjective and individual-specific understanding, experience and manifestation. Data from the MHC-LF provided scores on overall well-being, and emotional, psychological and social well-being, and indicated that 14 participants had flourishing mental health, and three were moderately mentally healthy. The personal and professional lives of the MHPs were closely intertwined and impacted well-being in multiple ways. Certain temperamental qualities, personal insight from the field, supportive interpersonal relations and management of time, work, thought, behaviour and affect were protective factors of well-being. Additional responsibilities at work, negativities in client narratives, stigma and myths associated with the profession, biases from other professionals, lack of opportunities for personal development and growth, insufficient infrastructural and human resources were threats to well-being. The findings of the study have implications for policy, education and training, and practice for mental health practitioners. © 2018, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Happiness; Mental health professionals; Positive psychology; Well-being,"Department of Psychology, Miami University, Oxford, OH, United States; The School of Human Ecology, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",English
"Duggal C., Sriram S., Jain K.",Marriage Counsellors’ Reflections on the Counselling Process in Family Courts in India,2018,Psychological Studies,"Family courts in India were established to facilitate speedy redressal of family disputes, particularly matrimonial issues. Marriage counsellors facilitated dispute resolution based on alternative dispute resolution practices. Counselling was mandated for all couples approaching family courts due to marital discord. At present, there is a lack of literature on the process of counselling followed by marriage counsellors in the family courts. The present study used an exploratory research design to understand marriage counsellors’ perspectives on the process of counselling in family courts. Fifty-six marriage counsellors completed open-ended questionnaires on counselling assessment, goals, interventions and the influence of the presence of children on the couple counselling process. Thematic text analysis of the responses revealed a range of areas that counsellors explored, individual and relational goals that they focused on, as well as the interventions used by marriage counsellors in their work with couples. Findings suggested that there was a lack of uniformity in the counselling approaches used by marriage counsellors. Additionally, marriage counsellors reported not being equipped to address some intrapersonal and interpersonal concerns that emerged in the counselling process, despite identifying them. Based on the findings, the paper recommends the need for a unifying framework for training and practice for marriage counsellors working with couples in family courts to conceptualise couples’ concerns as well as guide their goals and interventions. The paper underscores the need for acknowledging sociocultural influences, reflective practice and client feedback in the process of counselling. © 2018, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Counselling process; Couple counselling; Family courts; Marital counselling,"School of Human Ecology, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, 400088, India",English

We examined how stigma is associated with health outcomes and quality of life among rural women living with HIV in South India (N = 600). Interviewer-administered measures assessed multiple dimensions of stigma, as well as loneliness, social support, ART adherence, time since diagnosis, and quality of life. Internalized stigma and a lack of social support were associated with a lower quality of life, while the association between internalized stigma and adherence was mediated by the use of stigma-avoidant coping strategies, suggesting that keeping one’s diagnosis a secret may make it more difficult to take one’s medications. These findings suggest that these women constitute a vulnerable population who need additional services to optimize their health and who might benefit from peer support interventions and stigma-reduction programs for family and community members. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Adherence; HIV stigma; India; Quality of life; Rural women,"University of California, San Francisco, 550 16th St, 3rd floor, San Francisco, CA  94158, United States; St John’s Research Institute, Bangalore, India; University of California, Los Angeles, United States; University of California, Irvine, United States; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India",English

This is because breaches force them to the brink that they start abstaining from full disclosure of their condition. This type of condition has a negative effect on scientific research, patients and all stakeholders. A blockchain-based data sharing system is proposed to tackle this issue, which employs immutability and autonomy properties of the blockchain to sufficiently resolve challenges associated with access control and handle sensitive data. Our proposed system is supported by a Discrete Wavelet Transform to enhance the overall security, and a Genetic Algorithm technique to optimise the queuing optimization technique as well. Introducing this cryptographic key generator enhances the immunity and system access control, which allows verifying users securely in a fast way. This design allows further accountability since all users involved are already known and the blockchain records a log of their actions. Only when the users’ cryptographic keys and identities are confirmed, the system allows requesting data from the shared queuing requests.

This research validates a scale assessing this model – the Identity Leadership Inventory (ILI). We present results from an international project with data from all six continents and from more than 20 countries/regions with 5,290 participants. The ILI was translated (using back-translation methods) into 13 different languages (available in the Appendix S1) and used along with measures of other leadership constructs (i.e., leader–member exchange [LMX], transformational leadership, and authentic leadership) as well as employee attitudes and (self-reported) behaviours – namely identification, trust in the leader, job satisfaction, innovative work behaviour, organizational citizenship behaviour, and burnout. Results provide consistent support for the construct, discriminant, and criterion validity of the ILI across countries. We show that the four dimensions of identity leadership are distinguishable and that they relate to important work-related attitudes and behaviours above and beyond other leadership constructs. Finally, we also validate a short form of the ILI, noting that is likely to have particular utility in applied contexts. Practitioner points: The Identity Leadership Inventory (ILI) has a consistent factor structure and high predictive value across 20 countries and can thus be used to assess a leader's ability to manage (team and organizational) identities in a range of national and cultural contexts. Identity leadership as perceived by employees is uniquely related to important indicators of leadership effectiveness including employees’ relationship to their team (identification and perceived team support), well-being (job satisfaction and reduced burnout), and performance (citizenship and innovative behaviour at work). The ILI can be used in practical settings to assess and develop leadership, for instance, in 360-degree feedback systems. The short form of the ILI is also a valid assessment of identity leadership, and this is likely to be useful in a range of applied contexts (e.g., those where there is a premium on cost and time or when comparing multiple leaders or multiple time points). © 2018 The British Psychological Society",cross-cultural validation; Identity Leadership Inventory; leadership; social identity,"Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany; AFI, Oslo, Norway; University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France; ESCP Europe Business School, London, United Kingdom; University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia; Freie Universität Berlin, Germany; Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey; Trento University, Italy; University of South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa; Durham University Business School, United Kingdom; KU Leuven, Belgium; Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands; Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile; Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel; University of Helsinki, Finland; Ministry of Finance, Thessaloniki, Greece; Ivey Business School, London, ON, Canada; Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary; Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal; China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), Shanghai, China; Kyoto University, Japan; Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; T A Pai Management Institute, Manipal, Karnataka, India; BI Norwegian Business School, Oslo, Norway; Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China",English

Understanding the Impact of a ‘Support, Appreciate, Listen Team’ (SALT)-Based Suicide Prevention Peer Education Program on Peer Educators",2018,School Mental Health,"Youth suicide is a public health problem in India, and young people in school, particularly adolescents, experience heavy psychological burden. Prevention programs, involving peer educators (PEs), have proved useful strategies to address this problem, but their impact on the PEs is less understood, particularly in India. This qualitative study aims to explore the changes observed in PE students who were involved in a ‘mindfulness’ and ‘Support-Appreciate-Listen–Team’ (SALT)-based peer education program to address suicidal behavior in Indian school students. One hundred and fourteen students were trained as PEs in six high schools in Pune to identify and respond to the needs of students in distress. By listening to the narratives of the PEs, their parents, school authorities, and the associated NGO team, we reflect on perceived social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive changes in PEs. The PEs demonstrated enhanced caring for those in distress both inside and outside school by improved listening skills, self-awareness, care, and empathy. Furthermore, the program had a positive impact on their broad emotional intelligence and PEs expressed increased ownership of life, taking action, and seeking support where needed. The study concludes that mindfulness and SALT-based peer education (PE) programs are valuable for the PEs. This could be used to motivate PEs to volunteer in such programs.

However, there are few case reports available in modern times describing about 30 patients with this condition. The psychosis may occur in the premenstrual phase in some patients and in others it begins with the onset of menses. Polymorphic psychosis is the commonly described clinical picture in these patients with an admixture of mood symptoms and psychotic symptoms. We describe a 42-year old lady who developed psychotic symptoms with the onset of her menses. The patient had irritability and aggression, persecutory ideas, hallucinatory behavior, increased religiosity, formal thought disorder, disorganized behavior and poor self-care lasting for about 20 days after which she will spontaneously remit for about 10 days till the onset of her next menses. These symptoms began about 13 years after her last childbirth and were present in this cyclical manner for the last seven years. She was admitted in view of gross disorganization and was treated with 4 mg per day of risperidone. She did not develop symptoms with onset of her next menstrual period and was discharged. She maintained well on the prophylaxis for a period of three months. After that, she discontinued medications and had a relapse of symptoms lasting the first two weeks of her menstrual cycle and remained well for about two weeks thereafter. Hormonal assays did not reveal abnormal levels of gonadal hormones. We discuss the association between menstrual cycles and the potential association of psychosis with estrogen levels. Various conditions that lead to fluctuation in estrogen levels, such as menopause, postpartum period as well as post-oopherectomy period have been described to lead to a risk for psychotic symptoms. Similarly, the cyclical changes in estrogen levels during the course of a menstrual cycle leads to psychosis in some women. © 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Episodic psychosis; estrogen; menstrual psychosis,"Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India",English

The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of domestic violence and injuries owing to domestic violence among currently married women. Materials and Methods: This was a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted in the rural and urban areas of Haryana. In total, 880 currently married females of the reproductive age group were interviewed using the Women's Questionnaire (used in National Family Health Survey-3) which is according to the Modified Conflict Tactics Scale. Results: Totally, 37% of the females had ever experienced domestic violence and 28.9% currently experienced domestic violence. All types of violence (except sexual violence) were significantly more common in the rural area than the urban area. Injuries owing to domestic violence were reported by more than half (55.4%) of the women. Among spousal violence, emotional violence was the most common type of violence followed by physical violence. Only 0.1% and 4.5% of females had ever initiated physical and emotional violence respectively, against their husbands, and in rest of the cases, it was the husband who initiated violence.

Experience of infertility profoundly affects the personal well-being of women. Women with infertility are at a higher risk of anxiety, depression, and Intimate partner violence (IPV). In this background the present study was carried out to determine IPV and psychiatric comorbidity in women with infertility. Methods: Hundred consecutive women with primary infertility in the age group of 18 years to 45 years were included in the study. Psychiatric diagnosis was made according to DSM-5. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) were used to assess the severity of the anxiety and depressive symptoms. IPV was assessed using WHO violence against women instrument. Results: The mean age of the 100 women was 26.73 ± 4.23 years, duration of marriage was 7.11 ± 4.177 years and duration of infertility treatment in years was 5.56 ± 3.89. The prevalence of IPV among patients was 50% and psychiatric comorbidity was 46%. When we compared the women who experienced IPV and who did not, the prevalence of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder was high among IPV group. Anxiety, depressive scores in HAM A, HAM D were higher in IPV group compared to the other group and was statistically significant. Conclusion: A significant number of women who had infertility reported IPV. This emphasizes the importance of screening for IPV in these women. It is observed that women with IPV had higher psychiatric comorbidity and may require psychotherapeutic intervention. © 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Infertility; intimate partner violence; psychiatric comorbidity,"Department of Psychiatry, Oxford Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Oxford Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",English
Kaul N.,Rehearsed Language of Psychoanalysis,2018,British Journal of Psychotherapy,"Taking up Bion's idea of a continuum between the psychotic and non-psychotic parts of the mind, this paper looks at clinical moments where the primitive part – psychotic and ‘autistic-contiguous’ – mimes language and takes over the analytic field. The patients discussed seem to intuit the analyst's blind spots and a pseudo-language takes over as primitive parts of the patient collude with those of the analyst. The three patients discussed here use registers of speech which vary from over-abundant to quicksilver and dried. However, it is not as much a communicative use as it is evacuative and adhesive. Verbal language offers familiar moulds in terms of unfree associations, pre-existing narrative structures, syntax, figures of speech (symbols, metaphors, paradoxes) and common psychoanalytic tropes (dreams, primal scenes). Primitive parts of the mind nestle in these moulds rather than disturb them. It is only through examining the countertransference and abjuring collusions that the analyst may be able to contact the terrifying or enclosed parts in the field. ‘Death’, for instance, represents the limits of language and as it is unpacked, it comes to acquire a range of meanings which allow the recovery of thinking. I have tried to demonstrate the experience of verbal language as a seductive screen that analyst and analysand collaboratively create to make bearable the incomprehensibility of the encounter. In doing this what emerges is a ‘thick description’ that helped and reflects on different kinds of collusion. The paper tries to capture the experience of collusion as well as a return from it. © 2018 BPF and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Bion; Defences; Language; Psychoanalytic Technique; Psychosis; Symbolism; Transference/ Countertransference,"Delhi University, India",English

The aim of this study was to examine the level of harm associated with experiences of peer aggression, as well as bullying, by directly measuring the four elements of intent, perceived harm, repetition and power imbalance that comprise the bullying criteria. The purpose of the study was to establish whether bullying was the most harmful form of peer aggression and whether other types of peer aggression that did not comprise all elements of bullying were comparably harmful. Over 6000 students (aged 11–16) from 10 countries completed a student victimization and aggression questionnaire. Data showed that approximately 50% of participants were not intentionally harmed through peer aggression, although this varied across countries, ranging from 10% in India to 87.5% in Taiwan. In all countries, analyses identified a group that had experienced repeated peer aggression, but with no power imbalance, comparable in size to the bullied group, suggesting that bullying is just “the tip of the iceberg”. Victims of bullying self-reported the greatest experiences of harm, although victims of repeated aggression reported comparable harm. The findings show that peer aggression experiences that do not meet the bullying criteria are also rated as harmful by victims. More research is needed to fully understand negative peer interactions that include behaviors outside the scope of the bullying definition, particularly with regard to repeated peer aggression. This study suggests that researchers should consider the level of harm experienced by individuals and avoid terminology such as bullying, while policy makers should place a strong and explicit focus on encompassing a broader realm of harmful peer aggression. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bullying; Harm; Multi-country; Peer aggression; Victim; Victimization,"Flinders University5001, Australia; The Philippines (Flinders University, Australia), Philippines; Universitas Negeri Makassar, Indonesia; University of Thessaly, Greece; University of Bologna, Italy; Hanshin University, South Korea; Punjabi University, India; Seoul National University, South Korea; Universidad de Córdoba, Spain; Jagiellonian University, Poland; National Taichung University of Education, Taiwan",English
"Verma S.K., Bharti P., Singh T.",Does stigma always have negative consequences?,2018,Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology,"The aim of this study was to explore and understand the phenomenon of stigmatization and the socio-cultural processes where a stigmatized group may enjoy the ongoing process of stigmatization against them. Generally, research works on “stigma” show that stigmas have negative effects on the stigmatized group. The stigmatized groups often claim that people are prejudiced against them, and therefore, they face discrimination, alienation, and comparatively reduced well-being. Besides this, stigmatized groups also face exclusion and marginalization especially with respect to poverty. In the Indian cultural context, stigma is attached to certain notions and beliefs that are used by stigmatized groups to earn their livelihood. These groups affirm such statuses that accredit them as socially and/or economically marginalized groups and use the associated social beliefs for their advantage. It can, therefore, be said that they feel pride in accepting the stigma associated with their identities. To understand these socio-psychological processes, three stigmatized groups, namely, eunuchs, beggars, and reserved category students were sampled, and data was collected using ethnography. Upon analysing the collected data, results revealed that eunuchs and beggars use social beliefs as a means for earning a livelihood whereas reserved category students freely utilize their caste identity for privileges without hesitation in order to get good jobs, enrol in education, and/or improve their living conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that stigma does not necessarily always have negative consequences but can also help the stigmatized group in improving their overall quality of life. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",beggar; caste stigma; eunuch; marginalization; social exclusion,"Vivekananda College, University of Delhi, Delhi, India; Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India, Ahmedabad, India; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Social Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India",English

However, the mechanism through which infection causes long-term behavioral defects is not well known. To elucidate this, we have used synthetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] which acts as a dsRNA molecule and interacts with toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3) of microglia cells to evoke the immune system, thus mimicking the viral infection. Rat pups of postnatal day (PND) 7 were infused with a single dose of poly (I:C) (5 mg/kg BW) and vehicle alone to controls. When these pups grew to 3, 6 and 12 weeks, their spatial and fear conditioning memory were impaired as assessed by Morris water maze and passive avoidance test, respectively. We checked the immune activation by staining of TNF-α in the hippocampus and observed that poly (I:C) exposure elevated the number of TNF-α positive cells immediately after 12 h of infusion in one week rat and it persisted up to postnatal age of 3 and 12 weeks. Moreover, poly (I:C) significantly decreased the binding of 3H-QNB to the cholinergic receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 6 weeks rats as compared to control but did not change significantly in 12 weeks rats. RT-PCR and immunoblotting results showed that poly (I:C) exposure upregulated the expression of memory associated genes (BDNF, Arc, EGR1) at mRNA and protein level in frontal cortex and hippocampus of 3 weeks rats as compared to control. However, long-time persistence of poly (I:C) effects significantly decreased the expression of these genes in both brain regions of 12 weeks rats. Taken together, it is evident that early life exposure to poly (I:C) has a long-term effect and impairs learning and memory, probably through TNF-α mediated neuroinflammation and alteration in the expression of memory associated genes in frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Developmental neurological disorder; Memory; Poly (I:C); Synaptic proteins; TNF-α,"Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221 005, India; School of Studies in Neuroscience, Jiwaji University, Gwalior, 474 011, India; CSIR – Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, 31 Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Lucknow, 226 001, India",English
"Shaw L., Routray A.",Topographical assessment of neurocortical connectivity by using directed transfer function and partial directed coherence during meditation,2018,Cognitive Processing,"Due to the presence of nonlinearity and volume conduction in electroencephalography (EEG), sometimes it’s challenging to find out the actual brain network from neurodynamical alteration. In this paper, two well-known time–frequency brain connectivity measures, namely partial directed coherence (PDC) and directed transfer function (DTF), have been applied to evaluate the performance analysis of EEG signals obtained during meditation. These measures are implemented to the multichannel meditation EEG data to get the directed neural information flow. Mostly the assessment of PDC and DTF is entirely subjective and there are probabilities to have erroneous connectivity estimation. To avoid the subjective evaluation, the performance results are compared in terms of absolute energy, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and relative SNR (R-SNR) scale. In most of the cases, the PDC result is found to be more efficient than DTF. The limitation of DTF and PDC in terms of the time-varying multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model is highlighted. The time-varying MVAR model can track the neurodynamical changes better than any other method. In the present study, we would like to show that the PDC-based connectivity gives a better understanding of the non-symmetric relation in EEG obtained during Kriya Yoga meditation in comparison to DTF. However, it needs to be investigated further to warrant this claim. © 2018, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Brain connectivity; EEG; Meditation; Multivariate autoregressive model; Partial directed coherence; Volume conduction,"Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, 721302, India",English
"Bag S., Seth S.",Does It Matter How We Assess Standard of Living? Evidence from Indian Slums Comparing Monetary and Multidimensional Approaches,2018,Social Indicators Research,"As part of Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations have set targets of upgrading slums and reducing poverty in all its dimensions by 2030. Policies towards improving the living conditions of slum-dwellers require proper assessment of their standard of living as well as understanding the associated characteristics. In this paper, using slum-level primary household survey data from three largest Indian cities, we, first, assess the standard of living of slum dwellers using both monetary and non-monetary approaches and then explore how various household and spatial characteristics are consistently or differently associated with both forms of assessments. We use standard monetary indicators, but to assess non-monetary standard of living, use a counting approach framework and justify the selection of specific indicators in the context of slums. Our analysis yields some interesting observations as some characteristics are differently associated with monetary and non-monetary living standards, which should affect policy designs in slums. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Monetary well-being; Multidimensional counting approach; Regression analysis; Slums in Indian metro cities; Standard of living in slums,"Department of Economics, Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi  110007, India; Centre for Development Economics, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Economics Division, Leeds University Business School, Maurice Keyworth Building, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom",English

The study identifies the critical districts of the Rajasthan state, which is the largest state of India with lots of diversity. The index facilitates linear aggregation and introduces penalties for unbalance values in the index in both positive as well as negative phenomena. Region specific dimension and indicators selected for the study highlights the socio-economic status, infrastructure, health care facilities, literacy and employment conditions in different districts. MPI results in the form of rankings, cluster maps and radial charts, classify all the districts in five ranks according to the combined performance in both the phenomena. The results highlights that districts Pratapgarh, Dungarpur, Banswara, Dhaulpur and Jaisalmer situated in south, northeast and west border of the state are falling in the category of low development and high poverty conditions, whereas districts Jaipur (capital of state) and Kota from south eastern region are the best performing districts of the state with high development and low poverty conditions. Further, important factors for each class are highlighted from indicator and sub-indices radial charts. Overall, the present research generates a case study results for preliminary application of an alternate index MPI in district level vulnerability mapping to strengthen the decentralized approach in policy reforms.

Mahoro J.,"Unmet need among married women: examining socio-religious influences on family planning use in Rwanda, 2005-2015",2018,International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the socio-religious factors associated with unmet need for family planning among married Rwandan women, and examine individual and contextual characteristics of married fecund women influencing their contraceptive use and future intentions to use contraception. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed merge data, which were extracted from 2005, 2010, 2014–2015 Rwanda Demographic And Health Survey’s individual women data sets. Characteristics of married fecund women with unmet need for family planning were compared using Pearson’s χ2 test. A binary logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the influence of socio-religious factors on contraceptive use, and future intentions to use contraception among married fecund women. Findings: Unmet need for family planning among married Rwandan women has significantly decreased over the past decade, from 39.9 percent in 2005 to 19.5 percent in 2010 and 17.5 percent in 2015. Women who are Protestants, residing in rural area, and having five or more children were significantly more likely to have an unmet need for family planning. Overall, the likelihood of having unmet need for family planning, not using contraceptives and future intentions for not using contraception was found statistically high among Protestant women compared to Catholics and low-educated women. Research limitations/implications: Unmarried women and men are not included to examine their role play and characteristics influences on family planning use in Rwanda. Investing in education of girls should be a priority for the future, without that there will not be equality in reproductive health and rights. Factors behind the recent slow motion of family planning initiatives need to be addressed in order to meet the reproductive needs and rights of all women. Practical implications: Public-religious collaboration to promote nationally Natural Family Planning in all healthcare facilities is extremely needed. Since the family planning initiatives have been recently very slow, investing in behavioral change programs through mass communication seems deliberately prudent. Social implications: Investing in behavioral change programs and promoting sexual and reproductive health education would improve women’s social well-being. Originality/value: This is the first-ever effort to examine the influence of the socio-religious values on family planning use among Rwandan fecund women. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Contraceptives use; Demographic and health survey; Family planning; Future contraceptive intentions; Religious belief; Unmet need,"Department of Population Studies, Annamalai University, India",English

The present study was aimed as a proof-of-concept to a previously proposed idea that combining a cognitive training protocol with auditory cue during sleep could cause effective lucid dreaming induction even among healthy participants who had no history of lucid dreaming. Eleven healthy male participants underwent baseline polysomnography (PSG). Participants were then divided into two groups: Lucid dream induction group (n=6) practiced cognitive training (Tholey-combined) for three months, whereas Control group (n=5) did not have such training. All were trained to move their eyes (left-right 3 times continuously) during lucid dreaming. Following three months, whole night PSG was conducted on both groups, during which participants were presented with acoustic stimuli during REM sleep state to facilitate lucid dreaming. Unlike control group, 4 participants out of 6 from lucid dream induction group reported lucid dreams during training period and 5 participants reported lucid during the second PSG done after three months with enhanced gamma power in fronto-central region (indicating hyperfrontality during lucid dreams). The participants also reported various aspects of subjective experience associated with lucid dreams. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of both cognitive training and auditory cues towards lucid dreaming induction in naïve participants.

"Nayak J., Naik B.",A Novel Honey-Bees Mating Optimization Approach with Higher order Neural Network for Classification,2018,Journal of Classification,"In the recent past, several biological and natural phenomena have extensively attracted researchers towards the rapid development of science and engineering. Basically solving the optimization problems in various Engineering discipline is a popular topic among the other problem solving strategies. Most of the biological processes include the swarm intelligence research areas where the activity and the behavior of real insects have been studied. One of the recently developed Swarm algorithms is the Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm which is based on the mating behavior of bees. In this work, a hybrid metaheuristic honey bee mating based Pi-Sigma Neural Network (PSNN) have been proposed to successfully solve the classification problem of data mining. The proposed approach combines HBMO with the PSNN and is compared with other techniques like GA (Genetic Algorithm), DE (Differential Evolution), and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization).

However, the pursuit of big data remains an uncertain and risky undertaking for the average psychological researcher. In this article, we address some of this uncertainty by discussing the potential impact of big data on the type of data available for psychological research, addressing the benefits and most significant challenges that emerge from these data, and organizing a variety of research opportunities for psychology. Our article yields two central insights. First, we highlight that big data research efforts are more readily accessible than many researchers realize, particularly with the emergence of open-source research tools, digital platforms, and instrumentation. Second, we argue that opportunities for big data research are diverse and differ both in their fit for varying research goals, as well as in the challenges they bring about. Ultimately, our outlook for researchers in psychology using and benefiting from big data is cautiously optimistic.

Currently, there is no internationally accepted standard to assess the functioning of individuals with ADHD. WHO’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health—child and youth version (ICF) can serve as a conceptual basis for such a standard. The objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive, a common brief, and three age-appropriate brief ICF Core Sets for ADHD. Using a standardised methodology, four international preparatory studies generated 132 second-level ICF candidate categories that served as the basis for developing ADHD Core Sets. Using these categories and following an iterative consensus process, 20 ADHD experts from nine professional disciplines and representing all six WHO regions selected the most relevant categories to constitute the ADHD Core Sets. The consensus process resulted in 72 second-level ICF categories forming the comprehensive ICF Core Set—these represented 8 body functions, 35 activities and participation, and 29 environmental categories. A Common Brief Core Set that included 38 categories was also defined. Age-specific brief Core Sets included a 47 category preschool version for 0–5 years old, a 55 category school-age version for 6–16 years old, and a 52 category version for older adolescents and adults 17 years old and above.

"Sahu A., Bhargava R., Sagar R., Mehta M.",Perception of families of children with specific learning disorder: An exploratory study,2018,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Parents have a tremendous influence on their children's academic and social success. Unfortunately, a majority of them do not have a concrete idea on how to assist their children, impacting negatively on both the parents and the child. Currently, there is sparse research on parents' experiences in dealing with children with specific learning disorders (SLD). The current study was planned to explore the perception of families of children with SLD. Materials and Methods: Five focus group discussions (FGDs) including 30 parents of children with SLD aged between 8 and 14 years were carried out. Each group composed of five - seven participants. A format to guide FGDs was made to bring uniformity across groups. The transcripts were analyzed using the content analysis method to extract key conceptual themes. Results: The parents showed lack of conceptual knowledge with regard to the SLD symptomatology as well as proper guidelines to deal with their child's problem. They displayed negative attitudes and reactions toward their child's diagnosis of SLD, such as rejection, denial, over-protection, and loss of hope. Their caregiving was also perceived to place physical, personal, social, financial, and emotional burden by the majority of parents. Conclusion: The study highlights the experiences of parents dealing with SLD in terms of their inadequate knowledge, adaptational difficulties, and burden. The findings also reiterate the need to focus on family perspective and experiences when working with a learning-disabled child. Various supportive strategies are required to empower families, which would help alleviate their burden. Moreover, parents' training to strengthen child's learning skills is also warranted. © 2018 Medknow Publications.

Most of the studies opt for a subjective questionnaire-based method. This study evaluates the psychological correlates of excessive smartphone use. It uses a telemetric approach to quantitatively and objectively measure participants' smartphone use. Methodology: One hundred forty consenting undergraduate and postgraduate students using an Android smartphone at a tertiary care teaching hospital were recruited by serial sampling. They were pre-tested with the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, Big five inventory, Levenson's Locus of Control Scale, Ego Resiliency Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Materialism Values Scale. Participants' smartphones were installed with tracker apps, which kept track of total smartphone usage and time spent on individual apps, number of lock-unlock cycles, and total screen time. Data from tracker apps were recorded after 7 days. Results: About 36 % of participants fulfilled smartphone addiction criteria. Smartphone Addiction Scale score significantly predicted time spent on a smartphone in the 7-day period (β = 0.234, t = 2.086, P = 0.039). Predictors for time spent on social networking sites were ego resiliency (β = 0.256, t = 2.278, P = 0.008), conscientiousness (β = -0.220, t = -2.307, P = 0.023), neuroticism (β = -0.196, t = -2.037, P = 0.044), and openness (β = -0.225, t = -2.349, P = 0.020). Time spent gaming was predicted by success domain of materialism (β =0.265, t = 2.723, P = 0.007) and shopping by ego resiliency and happiness domain of materialism. Conclusions: Telemetric approach is a sound, objective method for evaluating smartphone use. Psychological factors predict overall smartphone usage as well as usage of individual apps. Smartphone Addiction Scale scores correlate with and predict overall smartphone usage. © 2018 Medknow Publications.

"Singh V., Chakravarty S.",Are Quantitative Skills Critical for Business Education Program or an Entry-Barrier for Diversity?,2018,Psychological Studies,"Two prominent criticisms of business education programs are that they disproportionately focus on cultivating quantitative skills (i.e., the ability to use and analyze numerical/mathematical concepts) and that the programs lack diversity in terms of gender, social class, and undergraduate backgrounds of students. We tested whether the emphasis on quantitative skills is linked to this lack of diversity in business education programs. We drew data from a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program from a leading business school in India (N = 275). We analyzed three key outcomes (entrance test scores, program grades, and salary offers) for three attributes (gender, social class, and quantitative undergraduate degree) before and after partitioning of the quantitative and non-quantitative components of the academic outcomes. Before the partitioning of components, our regression models explained 63% of variance in entrance test scores, 42% in program grades, and 21% in salary offers, which was suggestive of the suitability of our predictor variables. Post-partitioning of the outcomes into quantitative and non-quantitative components, the key results were: (a) social class disadvantage was in both the quantitative and non-quantitative components of the entrance test, and in course grades; (b) female-disadvantage was in the quantitative coursework of the MBA program, but not in the entrance test, or in salary offers (p <.05); (c) individuals with a quantitative undergraduate education had no advantage in the quantitative section of the entrance test, or of the coursework; (d) social class, gender, and quantitative undergraduate had no effect on salary offers. However, salary offers were higher for those with work experience (p <.01), and most notably, for those who performed well in the non-quantitative courses (p <.01). On addressing lack of diversity, the results suggest that unlike individuals from a more marginalized social class, females’ deficit is selective and identifiable in the form of lower scores on the quantitative component of MBA coursework. Apart from identifying entry-barriers for diversity, our results are also helpful in discarding certain unfounded beliefs surrounding business education. For example, contrary to popular belief, quantitative undergraduate training has no advantage in business education. Moreover, quantitative course grades are not disproportionately valued in the job market for MBAs. © 2018, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Admissions; Business education; Education outcomes; Gender; Quantitative skills; Salary,"Department of Liberal Arts, Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, Kandi, Hyderabad, India",English
Sinha N.,"Understanding the Effects of Unemployment in Indian Graduates: Psychological, Financial and Social Perspectives",2018,Psychological Studies,"The present research attempts to examine the psychological impact of unemployment and understand the individual experiences of unemployed Indian graduates. It seeks to address three possible effects of unemployment, which are psychological, financial and social, along with a necessary scrutiny on how these individuals cope with their present unemployed situation. A qualitative analysis method has been employed to investigate the research objectives through employment of a semi-structured interview schedule among graduates in the age group of 21–23 years. The research findings suggest that unemployed graduates are psychologically impacted and sometimes experience feeling of worthlessness, social embarrassment and high level of stress. Some individuals also reported a lack of motivation and meaning in their life. Although, a majority of the participants agreed to have a decline in their psychological well-being, not all share the similar experiences of unhappiness and worthlessness owing to their unemployment. Therefore, this research also hopes to underline differences in the individual experiences due to unemployment. © 2018, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Financial effects of unemployment; Indian graduates; Psychological effects of unemployment; Social effects of unemployment; Unemployment,"École de psychologie, Université de Moncton, Canada; Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Canada; Centre for Neural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Hyderabad, India; Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Science, University of Allahabad, India; Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Dalhousie University, Canada",English

The current study was aimed at clarifying whether bilingualism speeds attentional disengagement. Reflecting faster disengagement, Mishra, Hilchey, Singh, and Klein (2012) observed an earlier onset of inhibition of return (IOR) for high than for low-proficient bilinguals. In contrast, Hernandez, Costa, Fuentes, Vivas, and Sebastian-Galles (2010) failed to find any difference between bilinguals and monolinguals. We investigated the source of this discrepancy, while improving methodology by using a large sample composed of 100 Canadians, objective assessments of second language skills (Nelson-Denny Reading test), and controlling for nonverbal intelligence, age, sex, and video-gaming. Results were analyzed with self-report and objective measures of second language proficiency as well as dichotomous and continuous measures. Compared to less proficient bilinguals, highly proficient bilinguals tended to respond faster overall, hinting at an executive processing advantage. However, contrary to Mishra et al.'s findings, bilingual proficiency did not affect either the onset of IOR or magnitude of IOR. © 2017 Canadian Psychological Association.",Bilingualism; Cognitive control; Disengagement; Inhibition of return; Orienting,"Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India; Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India",English

Measures of illness control belief, health-promoting lifestyle and obesity-related well-being were given to 100 obese diabetic women selected from outdoors of hospitals in Varanasi. Analysis revealed patients’ stronger belief in ‘doctor-control’ and ‘supernatural-control’ than ‘self-control’ of the disease. Nutrition, interpersonal relations, physical activity and stress management were given more importance in health promotion than spiritual growth-related practices. Belief in ‘self-control’ and ‘doctor-control’ of disease was negatively correlated with ‘psychosocial discomfort’, ‘physical discomfort’ and ‘psychosocial impact’ aspects of obesity, whereas ‘supernatural-control’ showed positive relationship with all aspects. All components of ‘health-promoting lifestyle’ were negatively correlated with ‘physical discomfort’, ‘psychosocial discomfort’ and ‘psychosocial impact’ aspects of obesity.

In this study, we adapt the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to investigate factors predicting consumer behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) towards mobile shopping apps, considering the impact of two manifestations of consumer's perceived risk: Privacy Risk and Security Risk. Because cultural characteristics may moderate the impact of these risks on behavioral intention and use behavior, we conduct two studies from two consumer panels from countries with significant difference in technology use as captured by the Computer-Based Media Support Index (CMSI), namely India (high CMSI) and USA (low CMSI). For both countries, the baseline UTAUT 2 constructs predict the Behavioral Intention to use mobile shopping apps (and subsequently use behavior). However, the manifestations of perceived risk are significant only for the country with the highest CMSI score, suggesting that cultural influences play a strong role in the adoption of m-shopping. Our study has practical implications for theory as it poses the use of m-shopping apps in a cross-cultural context, suggesting that privacy and security moderate intention to use differently across cultures as predicted by the CMSI. From that perspective, it also has practical implications for consumer behavior researchers and app developers challenged with app localization as well as retailers designing mobile shopping apps for an intercultural audience. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",India; Mobile shopping apps; Privacy risk; Security risk; USA; UTAUT2,"Young Lives, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom; South African Medical Research Council, What Works to Prevent Violence?

Violence affecting children undermines their health, education and development, often with negative lifelong consequences and intergenerational impact; in recognition of its impact on sustainable development, combatting such violence is prioritised within the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Multi-Country Study on the Drivers of Violence Affecting Children in Peru, Italy, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe sought to understand what drives violence in these countries and what can be done about it, working hand-in-hand with national governments and local research institutes. Preventing violence is complex and strategies to address it in all its forms must be understood and addressed within a child’s entire social ecology—including the constantly changing structural and institutional forces that shape childhood. Both the Study’s process and its research products are noteworthy. The human-centred design and applied approach, one that yielded national processes of data analysis and understandings of violence, generated a host of outcomes during the life of the study. On a national policy level, these include the engagement of government ministries not typically involved in debates around children’s well-being, as well as contributing to legal reforms and budget re-allocations that, in some cases for the first time ever, directed government funding to nationally-led violence prevention research. Using the research as an intervention, the study fostered institutional normative change across all four countries and within the corridors of power that are traditionally slow to respond to violence as a priority issue. The future challenge, currently underway, will be to support national partners as they apply the Study’s findings to improve prevention and response programming and advocate for sustainable change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",child protection; determinants; drivers of violence; Violence against children,"Computer Engineering Department, Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, India; AKCSIT, University of Calcutta, India",English

Noninvasive BCI techniques play a major role for this purpose. In this paper, we have proposed three algorithms of cursor movement using three well-known clustering methods (Minimum distance, DB-Scan and Gaussian Mixture Model). These proposed techniques are generally tested on motor imagery EEG data. We have performed multi-target based cursor movement using our previously proposed ""FindTarget"" algorithm (used for single target based cursor movement). However, we have also performed the comparative analysis of these three proposed algorithms based on internal & external validation indices and identified the best one for multi-target based cursor movement. The average accuracy of our proposed model is 68.4% (Kaggle dataset) and 70.36% (Openvibe dataset). We have evaluated the execution time of the proposed algorithms and found the most efficient proposed algorithm(O(n)) with respect to time and space for both the datasets. The result indicated that our proposed method gives more accuracy than all the previous methods of cursor movement. Our proposed method is more reliable, timely-efficient and experimental setup independent compared to other existing methods. If we choose the suitable algorithm based on time and space complexity then response time of multi-target based BCI system will be improved so that disabled people can effectively communicate with the external world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Brain computer interface (BCI); Cursor control; DB-scan; Electroencephalography (EEG); Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); Multi-target,"Centre for Media Studies, 34-B, Saket Community Centre, New Delhi, Delhi, 110017, India",English
Srivastava A.,Standardizing evaluation process: Necessary for achieving SDGs – A case study of India,2018,Evaluation and Program Planning,"A set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030. In Indian context, all these goals are very relevant and critical, as India missed the target on many components of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The author strongly feels that one of the key reasons was lack of an in-built robust system for measuring the progress and achievements of MDGs. Monitoring and Evaluation of programmes and schemes, aiming at different SDGs, in a robust and regular manner is therefore need of the hour. A National evaluation policy (NEP) would set the tone in the right direction from the very beginning for achieving SDGs. The paper taking India as a case study discusses different critical factors pertinent for having a well laid down national level policy towards standardizing evaluation. Using real examples under different components of an evaluation policy, the paper discusses and questions the credibility and acceptance of the present evaluation system in place. The paper identifies five core mantras or pre-requisites of a national evaluation guideline. The paper emphasizes the importance of an evaluation policy in India and other countries as well, to provide authentic data gathered through a well-designed evaluation process and take corrective measures well on time to achieve SDGs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Development programmes; Evaluation ethics; Monitoring & evaluation; National evaluation policy; QCBS; Sustainable development goals; Terms of reference; Utilization of evaluation,"Department of Public Health, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India; Department of Public Health, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India; Department of Public Health, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India; Department of Clinical Psychology, Government College, Bhawanipatna, Odisha, India",English

"Johnson A., George M., Goud B.R., Sulekha T.",Screening for mental health disorders among pregnant women availing antenatal care at a government maternity hospital in Bengaluru City,2018,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Introduction: Antepartum anxiety and depression are two of the most common risk factors for the development of postpartum depression. Women are at a higher risk of developing depression and suffering from mental disorders during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy have physiological consequences for the fetus, such as impaired blood flow leading to low birth weight, as well as cognitive delay and behavioral problems. Objectives: To screen antenatal women for common mental health disorders and to determine the factors associated with mental health disorders during pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional study among 208 pregnant mothers in the third trimester attending the antenatal clinic at a Government Maternity Home in a low-income urban area of Bengaluru was conducted using clinical interview schedule-revised (CIS-R) questionnaire as a screening tool for detecting the presence of mental morbidity. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Results: In the study population, 12 (5.8%) screened positive for antepartum mental morbidities, of which depression was the most common. 3.8% of all women screened positive for depression, with 15.4% demonstrating depressive symptoms. Overall, 82 (39.4%) had the presence of one or more psychological symptoms, including fatigue, irritability, anxiety, and problems with sleep and concentration but scored less than the CIS-R cutoff score of 12. Factors associated with the presence of antepartum mental morbidities included poor relationships with their spouse, poor/satisfactory relationship with siblings or in-laws, as well as the desire to have a male child. Conclusion: In the study population, 12 (5.8%) screened positive for antepartum mental morbidities. Considering the effects on quality of life for these women as well as poor fetal outcomes associated with maternal mental morbidity, it is important to include screening and treatment of mental morbidity as a part of routine antenatal care. ©2018 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society -South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",Antepartum mental morbidities; Mental health disorders; Pregnant women,"Department of Psychiatry, Sri Venkateshwaraa Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Pondy-Villupuram Main Road, Ariyur, Puducherry, 605 102, India; Department of Dentistry, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Puducherry, India",English

Aim: To study the association of explanatory models and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty consecutive patients with schizophrenia attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic were recruited in the study and administered the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the modified Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) Scale to assess severity of psychosis, explanatory models of illness, and quality of life. Sociodemographic and clinical details of patients were also recorded. Standard bivariate and multivariable statistics were employed. Results: Higher quality of life scores were associated with better socioeconomic conditions and lower scores on negative and general psychopathology subscales of PANSS. Quality-of-life scores were significantly higher in patients who did not perceive their illness to have negative effects on the different domains of their functioning. Conclusion: Explanatory models of illness are associated with perceived quality of life in patients with schizophrenia.

Total 168 healthy school-going adolescents studying in 9th grade were selected randomly from morning shift (n = 84) and dayshift (n = 84) schools. The study was undertaken longitudinally for a period of 2 years. Study encompassed administration of questionnaire and collection of saliva samples from the participants. Activity of salivary alpha amylase (sAA) activity was estimated spectrophotometrically and statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between sAA activity and sleep duration. Excessive daytime sleepiness among students was also studied in association with sAA activity. sAA activity of students was found to have a negative correlation with the duration of sleep and a positive correlation with their level of sleepiness. Morning shift students were found to have significantly less sleep and correspondingly higher sAA activity as compared to dayshift students. A significant increase in the sAA activity was noticed in the second year as the students progressed from 9th to 10th grade. Higher amylase activity was also observed in sleep deprived students suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness irrespective of school timings. Salivary alpha amylase activity increases in saliva in response to sleep deprivation. School timings may modulate sleep duration of students. Present finding reveals that sAA could be an appropriate non-invasive biochemical marker for the objective assessment of sleep deprivation among individuals as well as at population level. © 2018, Japanese Society of Sleep Research.",Adolescents; Excessive daytime sleepiness; Salivary alpha amylase; Sleep deprivation,"Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Shivaji University, Kolhapur, 416 004, India; Thin Film Materials Laboratory, Department of Physics, Shivaji University, Kolhapur, 416 004, India; Polymer Energy Materials Laboratory, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, 61186, South Korea",English

The structural, morphological, and photophysical properties of pyrene thin films have been investigated as a function of perylene contents. X-ray diffraction studies of doped thin films show well-defined peaks, and estimated crystallite size decreases with increasing perylene content, due to the formation of closed packed crystal structure. SEM images of pure pyrene revealed smooth, and compact and separated crystals with amounts of perylene. The result of absorption spectra showed decrease in intensity with perylene content. However, the fluorescence spectra of pyrene containing higher amounts of perylene showed broad and structureless exciplex emission at 510 nm. The emission colour of pyrene luminophors tuned from blue to green by controlling the concentration of perylene. The phenomenon of change in colour was seen due to efficient excitation energy transfer from pyrene to perylene in thin films. It also found that the intensity of exciplex emission increases with increasing concentration of perylene is of high demand in fluorescent lamp as well as green organic light emitting diodes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Enhanced exciplex emission; Excitation energy transfer etc; Perylene; Pyrene; Thin films,"Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, India",English

The Effect of Sense of Responsibility,2018,Journal of Behavioral Decision Making,"We tested the hypothesis that a sense of responsibility drives group representatives' decisions to be more risk averse compared with decisions made by individuals. The hypothesis was supported when the monetary considerations (i.e., payoff inequality and the magnitude effect) were controlled for in the potential gain domain as well as in the potential loss domain. Evidence showed that this is because the group representatives were concerned about how they would view themselves (e.g., guilt and self-blame) and also how they would be viewed by others (i.e., to avoid being blamed and looked down upon by others).

"Sharma C., Paramati S.R.",Measuring Inequality of Opportunity for the Backward Communities: Regional Evidence from the Indian Labour Market,2018,Social Indicators Research,"The affirmative action policy for socially and economically backward communities in employment has been a debated issue in India. In this context, this paper aims to analyze the level of inequality by distinguishing between ‘circumstance’ and ‘effort’ factors in the Roemer’s framework on equality of opportunity. We measure inequality of opportunities due to two circumstances: caste and religion. Our empirical analysis, at state-level, utilizes a recent household survey data, which provides information related to efforts as well as circumstances of workers. The paper estimated inequality in the labour market and then decomposed it to know the circumstances that cause income inequality. Our estimates indicated that inequality and inequality of opportunity is substantially higher in India. Specifically, the outcome of our analysis evidently indicated that the socially backward communities do have economically disadvantageous position in some of the Indian states. However, the degree of circumstances based on inequality varies to a great extent among the states. Therefore, we suggest that the country does not need a nation-level affirmative action policy instead a state-level policy could be more appropriate as the intensity of the problem differ significantly among the Indian states. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Caste; India; Inequality; Inequality of opportunity; Religion,"Department of Fertility Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Govandi Station Road, Deonar, Mumbai, 400088, India; International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, Kathmandu, Nepal; Population Council, New Delhi, India",English

People living in mountainous regions are vulnerable and more likely to experience multiple deprivation. However, few studies have addressed multidimensional poverty in mountainous regions. Using data from 4290 households of poverty and vulnerability assessment survey and the Alkire–Foster methodology, this paper estimate and decompose multidimensional poverty in the states of Shan and Chin in Myanmar. The multidimensional poverty is measured in five dimensions and a set of twelve indicators. Nearly half of the population in Shan and three-quarters in Chin were multidimensionally poor. The average intensity of poverty was 44% in Chin and 38% in Shan. The multidimensional poverty index was 0.33 in Chin and 0.19 in Shan. The level of multidimensional poverty in Chin was similar to that in of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Chin, 60% of the population was both multidimensionally poor and consumption poor, but in Shan, it was 20%. About 28% of the population in Shan and 15% in Chin were multidimensionally poor but not consumption poor. Deprivation in education accounts for one-third of the multidimensional poverty in Shan; while deprivation in health accounts for one-third of the multidimensional poverty in Chin. A higher proportion of multidimensionally poor had experienced shocks such as the death of a household member, agricultural loss, or death of livestock compared to the multidimensional non-poor. Multidimensional poverty was significantly higher for rural household, households with lower educational attainment, consumption poor and among those who lived in Chin. Poverty reduction programs require a holistic understanding of poverty and its different dimensions as well as the main contributing factors for effective planning and program implementation. Geographical targeting of poverty reduction program and larger investment in food, health, water, energy and education can reduce the extent of multidimensional poverty in Shan and Chin. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Chin; Mountain regions; Multidimensional poverty; Multidimensional poverty index; Myanmar; Poverty assessment; Shan,"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, India; School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjavur, India",English
"Shah A., Jain R., Brockmann A.",Egr-1: A candidate transcription factor involved in molecular processes underlying time-memory,2018,Frontiers in Psychology,"In honey bees, continuous foraging is accompanied by a sustained up-regulation of the immediate early gene Egr-1 (early growth response protein-1) and candidate downstream genes involved in learning and memory. Here, we present a series of feeder training experiments indicating that Egr-1 expression is highly correlated with the time and duration of training even in the absence of the food reward. Foragers that were trained to visit a feeder over the whole day and then collected on a day without food presentation showed Egr-1 up-regulation over the whole day with a peak expression around 14:00. When exposed to a time-restricted feeder presentation, either 2 h in the morning or 2 h in the evening, Egr-1 expression in the brain was up-regulated only during the hours of training. Foragers that visited a feeder in the morning as well as in the evening showed two peaks of Egr-1 expression. Finally, when we prevented time-trained foragers from leaving the colony using artificial rain, Egr-1 expression in the brains was still slightly but significantly up-regulated around the time of feeder training. In situ hybridization studies showed that active foraging and time-training induced Egr-1 up-regulation occurred in the same brain areas, preferentially the small Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies and the antennal and optic lobes. Based on these findings we propose that foraging induced Egr-1 expression can get regulated by the circadian clock after time-training over several days and Egr-1 is a candidate transcription factor involved in molecular processes underlying time-memory. © 2018 Shah, Jain and Brockmann.",small Kenyon cells; Anticipation; Egr-1; Honey bee foraging; Time-memory,"Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India; Department of Cardiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India; Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King’s College London, London, United Kingdom",English

Recent studies have reported elevated blood pressure (even in the normal range of variation) to be associated with a reduced responsiveness to emotions or ‘emotional dampening’. Our aim was to assess emotional dampening in individuals with more extreme blood pressure levels including prehypertensives (N = 58) and hypertensives (N = 60) by comparing their emotion recognition ability with normotensives (N = 57). Participants completed novel facial emotion matching and facial emotion labelling tasks following blood pressure measurement and their accuracy of emotion recognition and average response times were compared. The normotensives demonstrated a significantly higher accuracy of emotion recognition than the prehypertensives and the hypertensives in labelling of facial emotions. This difference generalised to the task where two facial halves (upper & lower) had to be matched on the basis of emotions. In neither the labelling nor matching emotion conditions did the groups differ in their speed of emotion processing. Findings of the present study extend reports of ‘emotional dampening’ to hypertensives as well as to those at-risk for developing hypertension (i.e. prehypertensives) and have important implications for understanding the psychological component of such medical conditions as hypertension. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",blood pressure; emotional dampening; explicit; facial emotion; implicit,"Barkatullah University, Bhopal, India; Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, India",English

The present study makes an effort to find out the role of attributional style and explore the relation between different types of well-being and death anxiety across gender in order to strengthen their adaptability with disease. Study was conducted on 80 advanced-stage cancer patients identified as patients as per their medical history and diagnosis done by treating doctors of the hospital, selected from different cancer hospitals of west central India. The obtained data were analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics using Mann–Whitney U test, multiple correlation and regression analysis. Results revealed that majority of patients expressed external health locus of control with significant gender differences. Negative correlation was found between health locus of control and different types of well-being. In relation to death anxiety and health locus of control, a positive relationship was found showing that externally oriented patients had higher levels of death anxiety. Finally, it was found that internal locus of control is associated with better quality of life and those who are internally oriented are better able to cope with their illness in comparison with those who are externally oriented. Thus, there is a need to develop psychological and spiritual resilience so that they can manage their illness in a healthier way. © 2017, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Cancer; Death anxiety (DA); Health locus of control (HLOC); Resilience; Well-being (WB),"Depart-ment of Psychiatry, Oxford Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, Bangalore, India; Department of Psychiatry, Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bangalore, India",English

However the nosological status, conceptual understanding of the condition as well as the diagnostic guidelines are all mired in controversy. Aims: The current study aims to study the psychopathology of Dhat syndrome in men by using a qualitative approach and to arrive at an operational definition for diagnosing Dhat syndrome. Method: The qualitative approach consisted of five Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and five Key Individual Interviews (KII) with participants, consisting of patients as well as doctors – both allopathic as well as traditional. Results: Detailed analysis revealed valuable data regarding the symptoms, causes, treatment measures, socio-cultural context, psychiatric co-morbidity, nature of the disorder and various other phenomenological dimensions. Ideas for future nosological positioning were also specifically looked for. Operational definition and diagnostic guidelines were also arrived at based on the analysis as well as on previous literature.

An excessive deployment of attention to external events as well as poor processing of self-generated events has been proposed to explain this misattribution. This study was done to understand the neurophysiological basis of source monitoring bias in schizophrenia. Methods: Seventeen patients and fourteen healthy controls completed a two-stage source monitoring task involving solving a three-letter jumbled word either by the participant or a computer following which they had to identify the correct source of the word – solved by self (internal source monitoring, ISM) or by computer (external source monitoring, ESM) – while EEG was recorded. P300 amplitude and latency were computed separately for ISM and ESM conditions. Results: P300 amplitude for ISM condition was lower in patients with schizophrenia compared to controls over right and left parietal regions. Additionally, P300 amplitude for ISM condition was lower compared to ESM condition in patients over right and left parietal regions. However, P300 amplitude for ESM condition did not differ significantly between the groups. In contrast to P300 amplitude, there was no significant difference in P300 latency in ISM or ESM condition within or between the groups. Conclusion: P300 amplitude was lower for internally-generated but not externally-generated events in patients with schizophrenia. These findings suggest that patients allocate less attentional resources to internally generated events resulting in poorer processing and consequent misattribution of their source of origin.

They also demonstrate higher impulsivity - while symptomatic, as well as when in remission. Impulsivity adds a risk of self-harming behavior to BD, and studies show that it increases with UA levels. Given this complex relationship, the current project aimed at comparing UA levels in first-episode mania patients with matched controls, and analyzes its relationship with impulsivity, symptom severity and disease prognosis. Thirty-one first-episode mania patients were assessed on BIS-11 and YMRS, serum uric acid levels were measured, and compared to matched controls. A follow up YMRS was rated after one month to evaluate the effects of treatment. We found significantly higher levels of UA in patients, which showed positive correlation with impulsivity and a negative correlation with symptom improvement at 1 month. The results of the study support a purinergic system dysfunction hypothesis in first-episode mania, and suggest its influence on impulsivity in this patient group.

The study aimed to examine the factor structure and to explore the cross-cultural utility of the MHC-SF using bifactor models and exploratory structural equation modelling. Method: Using multigroup confirmatory analysis (MGCFA) we examined the measurement invariance of the MHC-SF in 38 countries (university students, N = 8,066; 61.73% women, mean age 21.55 years). Results: MGCFA supported the cross-cultural replicability of a bifactor structure and a metric level of invariance between student samples. The average proportion of variance explained by the general factor was high (ECV =.66), suggesting that the three aspects of mental health (emotional, social, and psychological well-being) can be treated as a single dimension of well-being. Conclusion: The metric level of invariance offers the possibility of comparing correlates and predictors of positive mental functioning across countries; however, the comparison of the levels of mental health across countries is not possible due to lack of scalar invariance.

"Meyer A., Geary E., Heath D., Hiratsuka V., Salvador M., Sanchez J., Whitesell N.",APPROACHES TO THE EVALUATION OF CULTURAL ADAPTATIONS OF HOME VISITING IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES,2018,Infant Mental Health Journal,"The research that underlies evidence-based practices is often based on relatively homogenous study samples, thus limiting our ability to understand how the study findings apply in new situations as well as our understanding of what might need to be adapted. In a preliminary effort to address those gaps, the requirements for the Tribal Maternal Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) included the expectation that grantees design and implement rigorous evaluations to address local priorities and to help build the knowledge base regarding the use of evidence-based home-visiting programs in tribal communities. A priority that emerged across many Tribal MIECHV grantees was to determine the added benefit of the cultural adaptations that they were making to their home-visiting programs. While there is literature to describe recommended processes for making cultural adaptations to evidence-based programs themselves, there are very few guidelines for evaluating these adaptations. In this article, we review the varied evaluation approaches utilized by Tribal MIECHV grantees and provide three case examples of how evaluators and tribal communities worked together to articulate evaluation questions and choose appropriate and feasible evaluation designs. The lessons derived from these Tribal MIECHV evaluation experiences have implications for the role of the evaluator in diverse communities across the country evaluating home visiting and other evidence-based practices in settings characterized by unique cultural contexts. © 2018 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health",adaptación cultural; adaptation culturelle; American Indian and Alaska Natives; amérindiens et autochtones d'Alaska; cultural adaptation; evaluación; evaluation; Evaluation; Hausbesuche; home visiting; Indianer und Ureinwohner Alaskas; indígenas norteamericanos y nativos de Alaska; kulturelle Anpassung; visitas a casa; visite à domicile; évaluation,"Department of Psychiatry, MOSC Medical College, Ernakulam, Kerala, Ernakulam, 682 311, India",English
"Prathap A., Subhalakshmi T.P., Joseph Varghese P.",A cross-sectional study on the proportion of anxiety and depression and determinants of quality of life in polycystic ovarian disease,2018,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: The polycystic ovary syndrome is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphologic features. Earlier studies have shown that depression was significantly increased in the polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) group and also that PCOD women had marked reduction in quality of life, impaired emotional well-being, and reduced sexual satisfaction. This study was undertaken with the objectives of studying the proportion of anxiety and depression and assessing the quality of life and its correlates in women with PCOD. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional observational study on 64 PCOD patients using a pro forma for collecting sociodemographic and clinical details, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Ferriman-Gallewey score for hirsutism and WHO-quality of life (QOL) BREF. Results: Depression was seen in 93.5% of the subjects and anxiety in 100% of the subjects. The patients were also seen to have a lower quality of life. Lower scores were obtained in the psychological domain (68.80 ± 12.87). Presence and severity of depression and anxiety were found to have a negative correlation with QOL in all domains but maximally affecting the social relationships domain (P ≤ 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). Severity of hirsutism and nulliparity was found to have association with QOL in the psychological domain. Conclusion: The majority of women with PCOD in this study were found to have depression and anxiety. They were also seen to have a lower quality of life. Depression, anxiety, and hirsutism were found to have a negative correlation with QOL in all domains. © 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Anxiety; depression; polycystic ovarian disease; quality of life,"Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160 012, India",English

"Barre P.V., Padmaja G., Rana S., Tiamongla",Stress and quality of life in cancer patients: Medical and psychological intervention,2018,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Cancer pervades many dimensions of an individual's life - demanding a holistic treatment approach. However, studies with combined medical and psychological interventions (MPIs) are sparse. High-level stress and poor quality of life (QoL) can hinder patients' prognosis. The study thus aimed to analyze the impact of combined medical and psychological (psychoeducation, relaxation technique-guided imagery, and cognitive therapy) interventions on stress and QoL of cancer patients - head and neck, breast, and lung cancers. Methods: The study was conducted in cancer hospitals employing one-group pretest-posttest-preexperimental design. Descriptive statistics, paired t-test, Cohen's d, and bar graphs were used to analyze the data. Results: Findings showed high impact of the combined MPIs in reducing both the overall stress as well as the various components of the stress scale-fear, psychosomatic complaints, information deficit, and everyday life restrictions. Significant changes were also seen in QoL and its domains - global health status, besides functional and symptom scales. Results showed a significant improvement in physical, role and emotional functioning scale, while decrement in fatigue, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, diarrhea, and constipation of symptoms scales. Conclusions: It can be concluded that combined MPI has a positive impact - decreasing stress and improving QoL in cancer patients, which can further enhance their prognosis. © 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Cancer; quality of life; stress,"Psychology Department, Pace University, United States; Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, United States; Disparities Research Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, United States; Independent Practice, New York, NY, United States; St. Xavier's College, Bombay University, India; Pace University, United States",English

The current study focuses on understanding the spiritual zeitgeist entwined in the mundane day-to-day functioning (e.g., lifestyles/beliefs) of young people in India. Undergraduates at Xavier's College in Mumbai, India (N = 361; Mage = 19 years; Females = 67.7%; Hindus = 41.1%, Christian/Catholic = 38.7%; Other = 20.02%) completed a 30-item survey of lifestyle beliefs. Exploratory factor analysis indicated the presence of 6 factors: collectivism, materialism, collectivism, religiosity, personal agency, spirituality/wellness, and karma. These factors can be conceptualized as karma (action/word/deed-rewards/punishments) and dharma (duty/responsibility/righteousness) and tradition and nontradition (materialism/ambition). Data from a subgroup of the sample (n = 153; female: 92%; Hindu: 42.5%; Christian: 44.4%; Other: 9.8%; Muslim: 3.3%) indicated some overlap in traditional Indian values and Western conceptualizations of spiritual and religious well-being; specifically, collectivism (r = .22), religiosity (r = .75), and karma (r = .21) positively correlated and materialism (r = -.24) negatively correlated with religious well-being; religiosity (r = .16) and collectivism (r = .17) were positively correlated with existential well-being. Interdependent self-construal correlated with collectivism (r = .46), religiosity (r = .23), and karma (r = .22). Identification with being Indian correlated with collectivism (r = .23), religiosity (r = .29), spirituality/wellness (r = .16), and karma (r = .23) indicating a strong association between self-perceived Indianness and traditional values. This sample represents young people in Mumbai, which is at the forefront of globalization. Overall data indicate resilience of traditional Indian values and beliefs (e.g., karma/dharma) and change as reflected in endorsement of materialism, ambition, and self.

"Rutagumirwa S.K., Bailey A.","“The Heart Desires but the Body Refuses”: Sexual Scripts, Older Men’s Perceptions of Sexuality, and Implications for Their Mental and Sexual Health",2018,Sex Roles,"We use sexual scripting theory in the present paper to gain a better understanding of older men’s perceptions of their sexuality in relation to dominant Tanzanian cultural norms of masculinity. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 older men, and ten focus group discussions were conducted with 60 men aged 60–82. Participants’ recruitment was guided by theoretical sampling strategies. Consistent with the principles of grounded theory, data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously. Our findings indicate that Jando (male initiation rites) serves as a script for male sexuality that outlines the expectations and rewards of male sexuality. Adhering to masculine sexual script affects older men’s perceptions of their sexuality in later life and has detrimental effects on their well-being. Older men were concerned with changes in their sexual life, such as the decline in their sexual performance. The majority of the participants said they felt emotionally distressed about the age-related decline in their body and in their sexuality, and they reported that their inability to conform to male sexual scripts undermined their sense of masculinity. Several of the participants reported that in an effort to regain their previous sexual performance, they had turned to remedies and strategies of questionable appropriateness and effectiveness. Our study suggests that older men may benefit from age-related interventions tailored to their cultural background. These interventions may require trained health care providers on mental health issues to bridge the gap between the internalized scripts of ideal male sexuality and the reality of aging. © 2017, The Author(s).",Masculinity; Older men; script’s conformity; Sexual and mental health; Sexuality,"Faculty of Social Sciences, Psychology, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland; Institute for Housing and Urban Research, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands; Center for Behavioral Health Research, College of Social Work, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Knoxville, TN, United States; Department of Architecture, Çankaya University, Ankara, Turkey; Department of Psychology, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; School of Behavioural, Cognitive and Social Sciences, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia; Indian Association of Health, Research and Welfare, Hisar, India; Department of Human Studies, Libera Università Maria Ss.

We investigated the perceived use and efficacy of environmental strategies for regulation of general affect and sadness, considering them in relation to other affect regulation strategies and to subjective well-being. Participants from Australia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, India, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden (N = 507) evaluated the frequency of use and perceived efficacy of affect regulation strategies using a modified version of the Measure of Affect Regulation Styles (MARS). The internet survey also included the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), emotional well-being items from the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, and a single-item measure of perceived general health. Environmental regulation formed a separate factor of affect regulation in the exploratory structural equation models (ESEM). Although no relations of environmental strategies with emotional well-being were found, both the perceived frequency of use and efficacy of environmental strategies were positively related to perceived health. Moreover, the perceived efficacy of environmental strategies was positively related to life satisfaction in regulating sadness. The results encourage more explicit treatment of environmental strategies in research on affect regulation. © 2018 Korpela, Pasanen, Repo, Hartig, Staats, Mason, Alves, Fornara, Marks, Saini, Scopelliti, Soares, Stigsdotter and Ward Thompson.",Affect regulation; Coping strategy; Emotional well-being; Life satisfaction; Natural places; Perceived efficacy; Perceived health; Urban places,"Department of Higher Education, Govt. of Jammu and Kashmir, Jammu, India; Department of Psychology, University of Jammu (J&K), Jammu, India",English
"Gupta R., Bakhshi A.",Workplace bullying and employee well-being: A moderated mediation model of resilience and perceived victimization,2018,Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health,"The present study provides insights into the multilayered effects of workplace bullying on employee well-being by employing a moderated mediation model of resilience and perceived victimization. The mediating role of perceived victimization in the relationship between bullying and employee well-being was assessed. Further, the moderating effect of resilience in controlling the repercussions of bullying and subsequent victimization was evaluated. Finally, the study examined the moderated mediation impact of resilience and perceived victimization on the association between bullying and employee well-being. The proposed model has been tested among 512 employees, using structural equation modeling. The results of the mediation analysis showed an indirect negative relationship between bullying and well-being through perceived victimization. Moderation analyses indicated that resilience controls for the positive effects of bullying on perceived victimization and further mitigates the negative effects of perceived victimization on employee well-being. Finally, moderated mediation association between bullying and well-being was confirmed, indicating that resilience buffers the indirect negative effects of bullying on the well-being of employees mediated through perceived victimization. This study endorses the role of individual factors in a more comprehensive model of workplace bullying. Knowledge about such factors would assist in working out prevention and intervention strategies, thereby enhancing employee well-being. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Perceived victimization; resilience; well-being; workplace bullying,"Career Point University, Kota, India; Jaipuria Institute of Management, India",English
"Suri A., Hada B.S.",Analysis of trends in gross domestic and household savings and its components in India,2018,Studies in Business and Economics,"India is having a long-term oriented culture where people are more focused on their future rather than present. Due to this the savings rate in India has always remain at a significant level. India's savings performance has been quite impressive in a cross-country context. India's gross domestic savings rate in the recent period is comparable to Indonesia, Thailand and Korea, much lower than that of China, Malaysia and Singapore but much higher than that of many other emerging and advanced economies. India ranked 2nd in terms of gross domestic savings among top 10 economies of the world in the year 2015, just below that of China. The gross domestic savings which stood at around 23 per cent in 1990 has reached around 35 per cent in 2015, well above the world average of 23.5 per cent. Various factors which resulted in an increase in gross domestic savings rate are rapid economic growth, large scale migration of rural population to urban area, Rise in income of government employees after 6th pay commission, persistence of saving habits among households, awareness programs by government and financial institutions etc. Household savings has always remained a major component of gross domestic savings followed by private corporate savings and public sector savings. It was the result of high savings rate that the Indian economy stand strong during the global recession of 2008. During the tenth five year plan i.e. from 2002-2007 the increasing in gross domestic savings was maximum among all. Bank deposits have always remain the most preferred avenue for savings for households. Total deposits in Indian banks crossed Rs100 billion mark in 2017. © Studies in Business and Economics.

"Bhat A.N., Srinivasan S.M., Woxholdt C., Shield A.",Differences in praxis performance and receptive language during fingerspelling between deaf children with and without autism spectrum disorder,2018,Autism,"Children with autism spectrum disorder present with a variety of social communication deficits such as atypicalities in social gaze and verbal and non-verbal communication delays as well as perceptuo-motor deficits like motor incoordination and dyspraxia. In this study, we had the unique opportunity to study praxis performance in deaf children with and without autism spectrum disorder in a fingerspelling context using American Sign Language. A total of 11 deaf children with autism spectrum disorder and 11 typically developing deaf children aged between 5 and 14 years completed a fingerspelling task. Children were asked to fingerspell 15 different words shown on an iPad. We coded various praxis errors and fingerspelling time. The deaf children with autism spectrum disorder had greater errors in pace, sequence precision, accuracy, and body part use and also took longer to fingerspell each word. Additionally, the deaf children with autism spectrum disorder had poor receptive language skills and this strongly correlated with their praxis performance and autism severity. These findings extend the evidence for dyspraxia in hearing children with autism spectrum disorder to deaf children with autism spectrum disorder. Poor sign language production in children with autism spectrum disorder may contribute to their poor gestural learning/comprehension and vice versa. Our findings have therapeutic implications for children with autism spectrum disorder when teaching sign language. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",autism spectrum disorder; children; deaf; fingerspelling; praxis; receptive communication; sign language,"Department of Psychiatry, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai, 400022, India; Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India; Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605006, India; Department of Psychiatry, King George's Medical University, Chowk, Lucknow, 226003, India; Department Of Psychiatry, Dr D Y Patil Medical College, Kolhapur, 416006, India; Department of Psychopharmacology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, 560 029, India",English

"Kumar M., Dutt V.","Experience in a climate microworld: Influence of surface and structure learning, problem difficulty, and decision aids in reducing stock-flow misconceptions",2018,Frontiers in Psychology,"Research shows that people's wait-and-see preferences for actions against climate change are a result of several factors, including cognitive misconceptions. The use of simulation tools could help reduce these misconceptions concerning Earth's climate. However, it is still unclear whether the learning in these tools is of the problem's surface features (dimensions of emissions and absorptions and cover-story used) or of the problem's structural features (how emissions and absorptions cause a change in CO2 concentration under different CO2 concentration scenarios). Also, little is known on how problem's difficulty in these tools (the shape of CO2 concentration trajectory), as well as the use of these tools as a decision aid influences performance. The primary objective of this paper was to investigate how learning about Earth's climate via simulation tools is influenced by problem's surface and structural features, problem's difficulty, and decision aids. In experiment 1, we tested the influence of problem's surface and structural features in a simulation called Dynamic Climate Change Simulator (DCCS) on subsequent performance in a paper-and-pencil Climate Stabilization (CS) task (N = 100 across four between-subject conditions). In experiment 2, we tested the effects of problem's difficulty in DCCS on subsequent performance in the CS task (N = 90 across three between-subject conditions). In experiment 3, we tested the influence of DCCS as a decision aid on subsequent performance in the CS task (N = 60 across two between-subject conditions). Results revealed a significant reduction in people's misconceptions in the CS task after performing in DCCS compared to when performing in CS task in the absence of DCCS. The decrease in misconceptions in the CS task was similar for both problems' surface and structural features, showing both structure and surface learning in DCCS. However, the proportion of misconceptions was similar across both simple and difficult problems, indicating the role of cognitive load to hamper learning. Finally, misconceptions were reduced when DCCS was used as a decision aid. Overall, these results highlight the role of simulation tools in alleviating climate misconceptions. We discuss the implication of using simulation tools for climate education and policymaking. © 2018 Kumar and Dutt.",Correlation heuristic; Decision aids; Dynamic Climate Change Simulator; Experience; Heterogeneity; Problem structure; Stock-and-flow simulations; Violation of mass balance,"Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, 560029, India; Department of Epidemiology, Center for Public Health, NIMHANS, Bangalore, 560029, India; Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bangalore, 560029, India; E-health Research Center, IIIT, Bangalore, 560100, India",English

"Amirtha R., Sivakumar V.J.",Does family life cycle stage influence e-shopping acceptance by Indian women? An examination using the technology acceptance model,2018,Behaviour and Information Technology,"This study contributes to the literature that advocates the use of consumer segmentation by family life cycle (FLC) stages, which are found to have a greater influence on changes occurring in an individual’s life than age. It addresses the youth bias of most research on e-shopping adoption and the emergence of older e-shoppers as an attractive market segment by covering women of all age groups. It evaluated the effect of perceptions and attitudes towards e-shopping acceptance, as well as their variations across FLC stages, by using the technology acceptance model. The 10 FLC stages were selected by modifying the Duvall FLC classification system to reflect the Indian context. The results show that the different FLC stages have a significant impact on the e-shopping behaviour of women. While deals and discounts were found to influence all groups, time-saving and better decision-making through online shopping sites also significantly influenced e-shopping behaviour. Furthermore, the perceived usefulness and/or attitude were important factors that directly affected e-shopping technology adoption and usage patterns across a majority of the FLC stages. The study proved that FLC stages had greater power than age in explaining e-shopping adoption and e-retailers should not ignore them in designing e-marketing applications. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",age; e-shopping; family lifecycle (FLC); Socio-demographics; technology acceptance model (TAM); women,"Department of Epidemiology, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States; Department of Paediatrics, Asha Kirana Hospital and Charitable Trust, Mysore, India; Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States",English

Data on 2326 adults in care were compiled using an electronic database supplemented with medical chart abstraction. Survival methods with staggered entries were used to analyze time to ART initiation and loss to follow-up as well as associated factors. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to assess ART effectiveness. The mean age of adults in care was 36 years; 40% were male. The majority were married, had less than primary education, and less than 45 US dollars (3000 Indian Rupee) monthly income. The mean CD4 at presentation was 527 cells/mm 3 . The median time from ART eligibility to initiation was 5 and 2 months for before and after the PPP, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Becoming eligible after PPP was associated with more rapid treatment initiation (Hazard Ratio: [95% Confidence Interval] 1.49 [1.11, 1.99]). Moreover, among the 1639 persons lost to follow-up, more rapid loss was observed before the PPP (12.77 months) vs. after (13.37 months) (p = 0.25) and there was a significant interaction between ART status and calendar time before and after the PPP (p &lt; 0.001). Being on treatment was associated with a lower likelihood of becoming lost before the PPP (HR: [95% CI] 0.33 [0.27, 0.42]), but this association was reversed after the PPP (HR: [95% CI] 1.77 [1.54, 2.04]), p-value for interaction &lt;0.001. Treatment response measured by CD4 was comparable before and after the PPP (p = 0.088).

While watching these stimuli, the eye-tracking glass was used to record oculomotoric changes. Heart rate, blood volume and respiration rate were also recorded. After viewing each clip the participants had to label and rate the emotion depicted in the movie clip. The data was analyzed with respect to valence, motoric direction and arousal dimensions of emotions. Findings of the behavioural data and corresponding change in the respiration rate suggest that fear is the only emotion that equally impacted participants psychologically as well as physiologically.

We present a case of a 29-year-old male patient who was hospitalized with thrombocytopenia (WHO grade-3 toxicity) (unlabeled) along with extrapyramidal disorder, gastritis, and hyperprolactinemia within 2-3 months of initiation of tablet lurasidone 80 mg/day (Lurasid, Intas Pharmaceuticals) in bipolar depression. Dechallenge was found to be positive in three reactions except hyperprolactinemia (outcome unknown) during hospital stay. The terms anemia and leukopenia are well labeled/listed with the drug literatures of lurasidone. Thus, this case presents a strong probability of lurasidone to cause myelosuppression/bone marrow depression. © 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.",Bone marrow depression; lurasidone; myelosuppression; thrombocytopenia,"De-partment of Psychiatry, C.

Doctors are the person who has to be non-judgmental towards all aspects and types of sexuality while dealing with health care issues of society. But this is not true in all cases. In India, doctors themselves carry conservative attitudes for various aspects of sexuality, which can be a hurdle in transparent doctor patient therapeutic relationship. But if during the first year itself, the students are assessed for their attitudes, they can be educated for liberalizing their attitudes towards various sexuality.

"Manohar H., Kuppili P.P., Kandasamy P., Chandrasekaran V., Rajkumar R.P.",Implications of comorbid ADHD in ASD interventions and outcome: Results from a naturalistic follow up study from south India,2018,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the prevalence ranging from 14–70%. The current study attempted to assess the impact of comorbid ADHD in children with ASD, in terms of challenges in diagnosis, treatment, intervention outcomes and parental stress and coping through a naturalistic design. Methods: Fifty children aged 2-6 years with ASD were recruited, assessed and followed up for six months. Twenty children were found to have comorbid ADHD. Severity of ASD and ADHD was assessed by Childhood Autism rating scale and Connor's abbreviated rating scale respectively. Parental stress and coping was assessed by Family Interview for stress and coping. Results: The diagnosis of ASD was apparently obscured by ADHD symptoms in about 22% of cases, as only diagnosis of ADHD was made at the time of referral to our centre. ADHD was the most common comorbidity followed by intellectual disability and seizure disorder. About 66% of children received combination of pharmacological and behavioral interventions. Clonidine was the most common medication to be used and was well tolerated. The improvement in ADHD symptomatology showed positive correlation with improvement with ASD-specific interventions as reflected by change in severity scores. Severity of ADHD significantly also predicted parental stress and coping, and thereby engagement in ASD-specific interventions. Conclusion: The current study highlights the need for screening and early diagnosis of comorbid ADHD in children with ASD and vice versa considering the management challenges. In case of multiple comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders, early interventions for one disorder can improve the outcome of the other. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",ASD and ADHD; Behavioral; Challenges; Comorbidity; Interventions; Pharmacotherapy,"Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India",English
"Maurya M.K., Agarwal M.","Relationship Between Motivation to Lead, Mental Health Status, and Job Satisfaction of Male and Female Civil Police Constables",2018,Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology,"The purpose of the study was to examine the differences in perceptions of motivation to lead, mental health, and job satisfaction of male and female police constables. Police constables (N = 203, male = 144, female = 59) were surveyed at four districts (Varanasi, Mirzapur, Allahabad and Lucknow) in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Republic of India. Participants’ responses were obtained on questionnaires which measured demographic characteristics, motivation to lead (Dubrin, 1998), psychological well-being, psychological distress (Heubeck & Neill Psychological Reports, 87:431–440, 2000), and job satisfaction (Dantzker’s Journal of Crime and Justice 16:171–181, 1993). Results of t test analysis indicated that job experience, salary, education, motivation to lead, and psychological well-being were significantly different among the male and female police constables. Motivation to lead was a significantly positive correlate of job satisfaction among male participants only while psychological well-being was significantly, positively correlated with job satisfaction of both male and female participants. Psychological well-being also exercised partial mediator effects on the positive relationship between “motivation to lead” and job satisfaction in male police constables only. However, psychological distress was negatively correlated with job satisfaction of male police constables. The findings have significant implications for increasing job satisfaction in the police department. Findings indicate that the government should concentrate on removing anomalies in the job conditions of the female police constables so as to promote psychological well-being. Simultaneously, the police department should also pay attention to conditions which can increase motivation to lead among its female police constables. © 2017, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.",Job satisfaction; Motivation to lead; Psychological distress; Psychological wellbeing,"Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, United States; Department of Psychology, State University of New York, Buffalo, United States; Department of Psychology, Gargi College, Delhi University, India; Ferkauf Graduate School, Yeshiva University, United States",English

Rating scales are independent of clinical judgment and offer a reliable way to assess manic symptoms, making them good tools to improve both clinical and research diagnoses of bipolar disorder. However, there are dozens of candidates, with few obvious distinguishing characteristics, making it difficult to select one. Our goal was to metaanalyze the diagnostic accuracy of rating scales designed to identify [hypo]manic symptoms. Additionally, we explored potential moderator variables including global region, translation into a different language, and sample composition. Nearly 4000 articles were identified with searches in PubMed and PsycINFO, yielding 127 effect sizes from 103 studies that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) statistics reported by which a standardized effect size could be calculated, (b) participants age 18 + years, (c) reference diagnoses made by semistructured/structured diagnostic interview, (d) results published in English. Multivariate mixed regression models accounted for multiple effect sizes nested within sample. One hundred twenty-seven effect sizes across 14 rating scales were evaluated. There was significant heterogeneity across effect sizes; Cochran's Q(126 df) = 1622.08, p &lt; .00005, and substantial variance components both within (σ2 = .057) and between samples (σ2 = .253). Four measures performed similarly well and significantly better than some competitors after controlling for design and reporting features.

"de Wit E.E., Adithy, Chakranarayan C., Bunders-Aelen J.F.G., Regeer B.J.","Learning About Parenting Together: A Programme to Support Parents with Inter-generational Concerns in Pune, India",2018,Contemporary Family Therapy,"Rapid developments in the last few decades have brought about dramatic changes in Indian social life, particularly affecting new middle-class families. Inter-generational conflicts, high academic pressures, and modern anxieties lead to stress both in parents and in children. There is a need for parenting programmes that respond to these specific concerns, in order to reduce parenting stress and improve family well-being. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a parenting programme in Pune, India, based on a ‘theory of change’. In this pilot programme, parents were encouraged to learn in a group format about fostering autonomy in children, promoting academic potential in a stress-free manner and remaining in connection with adolescents. Facilitated by a psychologist, parents participated in four sessions involving ‘creativity and play’, ‘self-awareness and bonding’, and ‘communication’. The intervention was based on validated psychotherapeutic approaches and parenting methods to support parents in their learning. Some 16 in-depth interviews were conducted with parents before and eight interviews after the intervention to understand their learning experiences. Additional feedback was gathered from observation notes and debriefings after each session. The results show that the attention for playful quality time helped parents to (re)gain a more creative and flexible attitude towards spending time with their children. Second, parents learned to reflect on their frameworks of meaning (rooted in their own upbringing), listen attentively and communicate more mindful with their children. Furthermore, this study shows that an activity-based approach, connecting parents in co-creating new parenting paradigms, while supporting them with stress-reducing tools, is a useful way of engaging this target group. The study concludes by offering new perspectives for counsellors working with families in countries undergoing rapid change. © 2017, The Author(s).",Adolescents; India; Inter-generational stress; Intervention; Parenting stress,"Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, United States; National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, India",English

The study sample comprises of undergraduate students studying in a large private Indian university. The results of structural analysis using 280 responses collected from the undergraduate students support the hypotheses that academic and intellectual engagement constructs mediate the relationship between online engagement and affective learning. Moreover, it was found that compared to intellectual engagement, the role of online engagement is statistically more central to enhancing academic engagement and in turn affective learning.

Nirban G.,Mindfulness as an Ethical Ideal in the Bhagavadgītā,2018,Mindfulness,"The Bhagavadgītā (BhG) is a part of the ancient Hindu epic Mahābhārata. Being a quintessence of the Hindu religious tradition, philosophy and culture, it has exalting ethical significance for human life. As a prelude to the battle of Kurukṣetra, it is a colloquy between Ka and Arjuna, when Arjuna is disconsolate, distressed, confused and unwilling to wage a war due to emotional and moral dilemma. This paper suggests that Arjuna’s mental condition reflects psychological chaos on account of conflicting human emotions and Ka’s effort consists of arousing the spirit of mindfulness in Arjuna by encouraging him to focus on awareness of the present moment while befriending the mind instead of becoming a slave of it. Viewing BhG through the lens of mindfulness, this paper addresses and analyses the ideal of sthithaprajña (stable intellect, in BhG) and draws its parallel with the concept of sati (mindfulness in Buddhism) by elaborating how BhG emphasises controlling the mind by rising above the fetters of three guṇa-s (sattva, rajas and tamas—the qualities). Through an exposition of Niṣkāma karma (detached or disinterested action), the paper projects how the synthesis of the path of jñāna (knowledge) with karma (action/duty) and bhakti (devotion) actually paves the way for mindfulness as an important ethical value for individual and social well-being. It further draws attention to the point that BhG does not endorse reclusive or indulgent methods but lays emphasis on selfless cultivation of mindfulness as an ethical ideal. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Action; Bhagavadgītā; Bhakti; Devotion; Ethical ideal; Jñāna; Karma; Knowledge; Mahābhārata; Mindfulness,"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, United States; Indiana University, United States; Independent Consultant, India; SEWA Delhi, India; Nirangal, India",English

Gender differences have also been found to impact the severity and outcome in psychoses. In this background, this study attempted to compare psychiatric comorbidity between genders. Aims and objectives The aim was to compare psychiatric co-morbidity between men and women with psychotic disorders. Methodology A descriptive cross sectional study design was used. Data was collected through clinical interviews using standardized tools as well as the current case records. We used the MINI neuropsychiatric interview 5.0 to generate an ICD 10 diagnosis for primary psychotic illness and psychiatric comorbidity. PANSS was used to assess severity. Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Hamilton Anxiety rating scale, Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Fagerstrom Nicotine Tolerance Questionnaire were used to study comorbidity. Results 100 patients were included in the study. 61% of the population had a psychiatric comorbidity. 42% of the men had significantly more multiple psychiatric comorbidities as compared to 7% among women. Men had significantly more substance use than women. Age of onset of psychosis was not found to be different between men and women. Conclusion In this study men had more psychiatric comorbidity than women, owing to greater levels of substance use disorders and anxiety disorders. This could be one of the possible reasons for differing outcomes between men and women with psychotic disorders thus indicating need for systematic future researching in psychiatric comorbidities in psychoses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Comorbidity; Gender differences; Psychoses,"Faculty of Education, University of Macau, Macau; Department of Human Movement Science, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa; Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living (ISEAL), College of Sport and Exercise Science, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC  8001, Australia; Sport Management and Policy Department, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States; Degree college of Physical Education (HVPM), Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University, Maharashtra, India",English

A sample of 180 Indian female student-athletes at intercollegiate and inter-university levels with male coaches participated in this study. A questionnaire on sport-specific Touch and Behaviour versus Unwanted Intimacy from coaches (Vanden Auweele et al., 2008), consisting of 41 items on a 5-point rating scale was used. The participants were asked to indicate the acceptability of specific coaching behaviour as well as the occurrence of the behaviour represented in each item. The acceptability of the behaviour was determined by means and standard deviations, while the occurrence was determined by frequencies. Factor analysis was performed to determine the structure of the coaches’ behaviour and athletes’ acceptability thereof, which yielded four factors. Cronbach’s alpha was used to determine the internal consistency of the extracted items on each factor. Two factors, namely, unwanted sexual behaviour and inappropriate verbal and physical sexual behaviour, were regarded by athletes as very serious and unacceptable coach behaviour, while a third factor represented context-dependent suspicious behaviour (a grey area in which athletes differ in their opinion) and was perceived to be serious and unacceptable. A fourth factor represented acceptable behaviour.

In India, medical students undergo tremendous stressful situations and are a vulnerable group for such addictive behaviors. Aims: The aim of the study was to assess subjective happiness of 1st-year medical students and their internet addiction levels Settings and Design: A cross-sectional study done in a medical college in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Materials and Methods: Sample consisted of 150 1st-year medical students, who self-reported about their internet addictive pattern and subjective well-being on Internet Addiction Test and Subjective Happiness Scale, respectively. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out. Significance is assessed at 5% level of significance. Analysis of variance, Student's t-test, and Chi-square/Fisher's Exact test have been used. Results: Of the total sample, 42.7% of students reported of experiencing subjective happiness below the average, 41.3% had average happiness levels, and only 16% had scores above the average. Out of the students, 42.1% who had no internet addiction, 36.4% who had mild levels, and 54.8% who had moderate levels of internet addiction fell below the average happiness level. Conclusions: Those who had higher levels of internet addiction showed reduced subjective happiness. Thus, those who experience decreased subjective happiness without overt psychological disturbances are still prone to have addictive patterns.

Sundaramoorthy J.,Self-regulated learning strategies of active procrastinating pre-university students,2018,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,"Introduction. A common impediment to any student's academic achievement and well being is the phenomenon of procrastination. Procrastination has typically been defined as a trait or behavioural disposition to postpone or delay performing a task or making decision. It is vol-untary yet irrational delay of an intended course of action and frequently results in unsatisfactory, performance and emotional upset. Whereas, active procrastination is one's intentional decision to procrastinate in order to cope and focus attention on other tasks at hand and to experience performance pressure. Method. This study attempted to explore pre-University college (PUC) students' active pro-crastination in relation to their self-regulated learning. 120 PUC students were selected from four different schools of Gulbarga town in Karnataka state of India through multistage ran-dom sampling. With the demographic details of students, they were administered Active pro-crastination scale and Self-regulated learning measure. Results. Students of Educated parents and boys have higher active procrastination. Urban and rural students do not differ in their active procrastination. Goal setting & planning, seeking information, keeping records and rehearsing & memorizing strategies are significantly related to active procrastination Discussion and Conclusion. Urban students have higher organizing & transforming, rehearsing & memorizing and seeking social assistance SRL strategies.

Objectives: This study attempted to measure and compare self stigma among schizophrenia and alcohol dependence syndrome patients. PatientsandMethods: Across-sectional study performedon100 patients, 50 patients withADSand50patients with schizophrenia. A semi-structured data and internalized stigma of mental illness Scale (ISMIS) to assess self-stigma were administered. Results: Prevalence of self-stigma was more in ADS (66%) than that in schizophrenia (50%). The stigma in schizophrenia was significantly associated with unmarried and divorced; education above 12th standard; those who belonged to joint family, and urban region (P < 0.05) while in ADS, it was associated with education above 12th standard (P < 0.05). Only gender among the sociodemographic correlates was significantly different between schizophrenia and ADS patients with self stigma (P < 0.05). The locality and education status were found to be strong predictors of stigma. Conclusions: Self stigma is more prevalent in ADS as compared to schizophrenia and it is a significant problem in both. Therefore, there is a need to take specific interventions to improve overall quality of life and reduce stigma. © 2018, Author(s).",Alcohol Dependence; Mentally Ill; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Stigma,"Jagiellonian University, Institute of Psychology, India",English
Kulikowski K.,Measurement of work engagement with single-item measure,2018,Polish Psychological Bulletin,"In recent years, the construct of work engagement as well as methods for its measurement have generated growing interest in the field of occupational psychology. In this study, we aim to contribute to the current work engagement literature by investigating the possible advantages of single-item measures of work engagement by analysing their psychometric feasibility. Testing the validity of a single-item measure tool within the framework of the Job Demands-Resources theory, we have found similar pattern of correlations of single-item measures of work engagement with exhaustion, disengagement, job resources and job demands as for the well-established multi-item measure the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. The reliability of single-item measures tested with factor analysis and the attenuation formula was estimated to be in the range of between .60 and .70, the figure depending on the particulars of the estimation methods. Our findings provide an initial modicum of evidence that, if a research purpose requires it, or if the use of a multi-item measurement tool is overly restrictive or costly, then a single-item measure of work engagement could be effectively adopted. © 2018 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Method: One hundred consecutive patients visiting an orthopaedic out patients department (OPD) with chronic lower – back pain in a tertiary hospital were included. They were interviewed for major depressive disorder (MDD) using DSM-5 and assessed for the severity of depression, health-related quality of life and sleep quality using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Health Questionnaire Short Form (SF-36) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Proportion was compared using chi-square test, scores of scales were compared using the Mann – Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc multiple comparisons. Statistical data were analyzed by Graph Pad InStat version 3.06.A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The frequency of major depressive disorder and poor quality of sleep in patients with chronic lower – back pain was 74 % and 81% respectively. Patients with MDD had poorer quality of sleep, lower quality of life and higher functional disability. Severe functional disability due to lower – back pain was associated with severe depressive symptoms poorer quality of sleep and lower quality of life. The severity of depression is positively correlated with functional disability. Patients with a pain lasting more than 1 year had greater chances of depression. Conclusions: Patients with chronic lower – back pain had a high frequency of depression poor quality of sleep and lower quality of life, and higher functional disability. © 2018 Polish Psychiatric Association.

"Menon S., Rajaraman S., Kuchibotla L.",Well-being and self-transformation in Indian psychology,2018,International Journal of Transpersonal Studies,"This paper uses instances from literature covering a broad spectrum of Indian philosophies, art, medicine and practices—attempts to offer the components of a psychology that is rooted in transformative and transpersonal consciousness. Psychology, in this instance, refers to a systematic study of mind, behavior, and relationship, rather than the formal Western discipline as such. In the Indian approach to understanding consciousness, primary importance is given to the possibility of well-being. Such an approach facilitates an immediate comprehension of the unity of metaphysical opposites, such as matter and consciousness, and its experience as empathy, love and intuition. It involves a thinking that connects the gross and the subtle, the particular and the universal, the outer and the inner, the objective and the subjective, through a discipline of transcendence. This paper argues, based on carefully selected narratives from the Indian philosophical discourse, that the theories of the transpersonal developed in Indian wisdom traditions are founded on a practical body-mind discipline designed to lead to well-being and self-transformation. © 2018 International Journal of Transpersonal Studies.

Analyses testing whether the data best conformed to a one-or a three-factor structure found that both models appeared to fit the data equally well. To further explore if distinguishing between different domains of irrational beliefs yielded greater explanatory power, we ran an additional exploratory factor analysis. Results showed that there were differences in the relative mount of variance explained by each of the three content areas initially included in the original version of the instrument; work and profession, love and sex, and self-sacrifice and victimization. The work and profession content area accounted for a larger percentage of the variance (33.41%) relative to the other subscales.

Patro C.S.,Predicting consumers' acceptance of online shopping on the internet: An empirical study,2018,"International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning","Online shopping environment is a relatively novel perception and has changed the way people communicate and do the business. The rising internet penetration facilitated a shift from conventional marketing to interactive marketing. Online shopping is one such marketing service which is available to the consumers uninterrupted at anytime from anywhere through internet. The online consumers have more control and bargaining power than consumers of conventional stores because the internet offers more interaction between customers and retailers as well as greater availability of information about products and services. In a virtual environment where the website is just a mouse click away, it becomes extensively difficult to understand the consumers' behaviour and take effective measures to make them purchase online. The study focuses on identifying the key dimensions of the perceived advantages and risks that influence on consumers' online purchase behaviour.

Methods: Medical records were scrutinized to identify Omani children diagnosed with ADHD from 2006 to 2014 in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. The persistence of ADHD symptoms, school performance and dropout, as well as sociodemographic characteristics were examined. Results: Three hundred sixty-seven children fulfilled the diagnosis of ADHD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) criteria and 16.6% of them had dropped out of school. School dropout was associated with poor school performance, comorbid conduct disorder, and parental divorce.

This RCT essentially examines the efficacy of a competencies enhancing Internet-delivered intervention for Indian students. A total of 212 participants signed up for the semi-automated, text-based and self-guided program and filled program relevant competency measures (viz. emotional intelligence, stress, time and self-management) at pre-assessment and post-assessment. Results suggest that student participants (n = 75) randomly allocated to the experimental group of the trial have improved competencies of emotional intelligence, time, stress and self-management at post-test in comparison to the ones allocated to placebo (n = 56) and control conditions (n = 46). We deliberately used paired sample t-tests to check for significant differences in each of the components before and after the intervention. Our attrition rate was ranging from 21% to 59%, whereas the adherence rate was ranging from 35% to 48% for the four-phased process. Contrarily, the attrition rate for placebo (16%) and control groups (8%) were considerably low as compared to the experimental group.

The study has been carried out on 448 students staying in hostel dormitories of Pondicherry University. The variables studied were residential crowding, perceived control and subjective well-being. It was hypothesized that residential crowding negatively influences subjective wellbeing, also perceived control positively influences subjective wellbeing. In addition, it was also hypothesized that residential crowding influences subjective wellbeing through perceived control. The findings of the correlational analysis indicate that crowding has a significant, negative relationship with subjective wellbeing and perceived control. Also, perceived control has a significant, positive contribution towards subjective wellbeing.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a survey questionnaire from 1,302 managers working in eight Indian private sector organizations. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression analysis were used to test the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. Findings: The study found evidence of the mediating role of work engagement for the relationship between motivating job characteristics and managers’ turnover intentions. Conscientiousness moderated the relationship between work engagement and turnover intention. The total and indirect effects of motivating job characteristics on turnover intention were moderated by conscientiousness. Research limitations/implications: The study was cross-sectional, so inferences about causality are limited. Practical implications: The findings of this study reaffirm the crucial role of job characteristics in influencing work engagement and turnover intention. By examining work engagement as a mediator for the job characteristics-turnover intention relationship, this study explores the process through which job characteristics are associated with turnover intention. The findings of the moderating influence of contentiousness on the relationship of direct and indirect effects of job characteristics suggests that individual personality can influence social exchanges as well as managerial attitudes and behaviors in multiple ways.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 835 full-time Indian managerial employees working in different Indian organizations. Findings: Results revealed that workplace bullying positively correlated with silence (defensive, relational, and ineffectual silence). The hypothesized moderated mediation condition was supported as results suggest that PCV mediated the bullying-silence relationship and workplace friendship moderated this mediating pathway, i.e. indirect effects of workplace bullying on employee silence via PCV were weaker for employees with high workplace friendship. Research limitations/implications: A cross-sectional design, use of self-reported questionnaires, and gender-blind perspective to examine bullying are few limitations of this study. Practical implications: This is the first study examining employee silence in response to workplace bullying and one of the few attempts to examine employees’ passive coping strategies in response to workplace mistreatment. This study is also one of the rare attempts to examine bullying-outcomes relationship in the Indian context. Social implications: A well-formulated and effectively implemented anti-bullying policy and management support may encourage employees to combat bullying by raising their voices against it.

However, generally in disorders of progressive cognitive dysfunction creative skills are lost. However there are situations where these potentials are temporarily enhanced. Patients and Methods: We did an observational study of children and adults, 5 adults and 2 childrens, who showed extraordinary creativity evaluated based on evidence shown by patient, peers and re produced in test situation. Discussion: Our observational study reveals spontaneous interest in new and useful creative activity in our patients with various disorders causing progressive cognitive dysfunction. This observation reveals creative gain of function does take place in the face of progressive cognitive dysfunction in the setting of several diseases and it serves as a treatment option in behaviour management. Whether it is due to disinhibition of creative areas in the brain or facilitated function in regenerating data linking circuits needs further study. Conclusion: Set goals which are survival instinct based activities are probably removed by neurodegeneration and thereby the innate creativity gets disinhibited and expressed in wonderful forms of creativity. Whether special creative circuits in the brain, which causes this extraordinary creativity also needs to be studied. These creative skills in some of our patients served as effective pharmaco sparing agents during periods of aggression and agitation by engaging them in those activities, utility of which can be considered as a therapeutic option. © 2018 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",creativity; Progressive cognitive dysfunction; therapeutic options,"Central Research Laboratory(CRL), K S Hegde Medical Academy, Nitte University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Oncology, Nitte Leela Narayana Shetty Memorial Cancer Institute, Mangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Physiology, K S Hegde Medical Academy, Nitte University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Biochemistry, Nitte Gulabi Shetty Memorial Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nitte University, Mangalore, Karnataka, India",English

This study aimed at evaluating the effects of lutein against radiation-induced hematological and biochemical changes in mice. Methods: The optimized dose of the compound was orally administered for 15 days, and the mice were irradiated (6 Gy) on day 15 after the administration of the compound. The groups were divided (6 mice in each group) into normal control, radiation control, gallic acid control, 10% DMSO control, lutein control, and irradiated groups pretreated with gallic acid, 10% DMSO, and lutein. Gallic acid was used to maintain a standard since it is a proven radioprotector. Within 24 hours post irradiation, the animals were anesthetized and sacrificed. The hematological, biochemical, and antioxidant changes were determined using suitable methods. Data were analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier curve (log-rank test) and ANOVA (the Tukey test). The independent t test was used to compare the independent groups. SPSS (ver. 16) was employed. Results: Maximum survival was observed with a dose of 250 mg/kg b.wt lutein. The total leukocyte count and the percentage lymphocyte count exhibited a significant decline in the irradiated groups pretreated with gallic acid and lutein in comparison to their controls, whereas the percentage granulocyte count showed a significant rise. Antioxidant activity had markedly declined in the irradiated groups, indicating oxidative stress. Lutein pretreatment reduced the damage and maintained the antioxidant system. Conclusion: The present study suggests a protective role for lutein in palliating radiation-induced oxidative changes and maintaining the antioxidant system in vivo. © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

The sensor displays a turn-on fluorescence response towards Hg2+ in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio via excimer formation with a detection limit as low as of 30.6 nM. The excimer emission upon binding with Hg2+ has been rationalized by experimental as well as theoritical studies. Moreover, the [probe-Hg2+] adduct functions as an efficient sensor for cysteamine. This sensing process happens via the extraction of Hg2+ from the adduct. In this paper, change in emission properties of the receptor with varying pH and water content has also been explained. The sensing abilities of the sensor were examined in real water sample analysis. Therefore, the sensor can be used as an efficient and reusable fluorescent sensor for recognition of Hg2+ in water. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cysteamine sensor; Hg (II) recognition; PET and excimer mechanism; Pyrene moiety; Quantum chemical calculation; Thiophene,"Communication Area, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India; Department of Media and Communication, Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication (ESHCC), Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands",English

Context Collapse and the Networked Publics,2018,Journal of Human Values,"With the advent of social media and increase in networked publics, context collapse has emerged as a critical topic in the discussion of imagined audiences and blurring of the private and the public. The meshing of social contexts portends problematic issues as messages inadvertently reach unimagined audiences causing shame and leading to loss of ‘face’. In this article, we specifically study the impact of context collapse on some celebrities ‘who had it all’ yet, lost ‘it some’ to the world of networked public. The article examines celebrities sharing identity information across multiple contexts and explores situations of lost fame when ‘face’ is threatened, usage falters and breaks some of the well-established norms of interactivity. It concludes that lack of prudence in separating social contexts, loss of ‘face’ and social approval can dampen online celebrity presence. It proposes the use of ‘polysemy’ to simultaneously appeal to audiences from different contexts. © 2018, © 2018 SAGE Publications.",Celebrity; collision; collusion; context collapse; face; imagined audience,"Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, PA, United States; Campbell Collaboration, New Delhi, India",English

The model was tested for measurement and structural validity, mediation by MVP, and moderation by gender. Findings suggest that: (1) e-SQ dimensions of efficiency and fulfillment have direct effect on MVP; (2) MVP is a key mediating variable facilitating “indirect-only” mediation between e-SQ dimensions and online shoppers’ loyalty intentions; (3) mediation by MVP is not moderated by gender; (4) strong association between shoppers’ loyalty intention and intention to spread positive WOM; and (5) “saying” and “doing” are incompatible because online shoppers’ loyalty intentions or WOM do not translate into store patronization behavior. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",e-retailer; e-service quality (e-SQ); net promoter store (NPS); online shopping; shopper loyalty; theory of planned behavior (TPB),"Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong; Centre for Early Childhood Education and Development, Ambedkar University, Delhi, India",English

In the same year, India's Integrated Child Development Services Scheme served about 82 million children under 6 years and over 19 million pregnant women and lactating mothers. These 102 million beneficiaries received services in about 1.3 million centres. Method: This paper reviews the growth of the Scheme and considers challenges to scaling up quality with equity based on results of large-scale national or multistate studies. Results: The Scheme is associated with decreased malnutrition and better child development. The size and diversity of the country, the policy context, funding mode and lack of community awareness and engagement have hindered scaling up access while the approach to service delivery, low institutional capacity and poor infrastructure have impeded scaling up of implementation quality. Conclusions: This review illustrates the challenges associated with scaling-up access and implementation quality of a multicomponent, integrated early childhood programme in a large, diverse country.

"Verma P., Sinha N.",Integrating perceived economic wellbeing to technology acceptance model: The case of mobile based agricultural extension service,2018,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Adoption of mobile based agricultural extension services (AES) can serve as a tool for inclusive development in the rural farm land. This paper investigates the antecedents of behavioral intention in the context of mobile based AES. The aim of this study is to identify the important factors influencing the adoption of a mobile based AES in a rural context based on technology acceptance model (TAM). A survey of 327 respondents in rural areas was conducted. Structural equation modeling was employed to empirically test the complex causal relationship of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), social influence (SI), attitude (At), perceived economic wellbeing (PEWB) and behavioral intention (BI). All the six constructs are reliable and valid. The results show that social influence affects attitude, PEOU, PEWB and PU but not BI. Further, PEOU influences PU and attitude, while attitude and PU predicts BI. It also reveals PEOU and PEWB are antecedents to PU.

Method: 400 consecutive medical outpatients were asked about sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors associated with illness anxiety and filled in the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Psychiatric comorbidities were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). A score of 18 or above on SHAI indicated illness anxiety disorder (IAD), which was then confirmed using DSM-5 criteria. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17, Chi squared and Student’s t-test. Results: The prevalence of IAD in the sample was 7%. Around 18% of patients with IAD had positive family history for hypochondriasis; 32.1% had a history of abuse in childhood; 71.4% of patients had psychiatric comorbidities – 25% had depression and 28.6% had anxiety spectrum disorder. Discussion: The prevalence of hypochondriasis ranges from 0.4 to 14% in various studies and it is more common in the third and fourth decade of life. Significant risk factors include divorce, family history and history of abuse. Between 65 and 88% of patients with hypochondriasis have psychiatric comorbidities such as depression and anxiety disorders. Managing psychiatric comorbidities and early treatment of both will lead to better prognosis. Conclusion: The anxiety of having a serious medical illness is reasonably high in patients attending medical outpatients departments. About three-quarters of these patients had a comorbid psychiatric condition, mostly depression and anxiety disorder. © Polish Psychiatric Association.

Yet few studies examined IPV, childhood abuse, and abuse from in-laws together. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between IPV, childhood abuse, and abuse from in-laws, and types of abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) among women utilizing community health services for the economically disadvantaged in India. This study contributes to expanding the literature on abuse experience and providing knowledge for developing intervention programs and research projects to improve health and safety of economically disadvantaged women. The data were collected from women aged 18 years old or older at 18 community health centers that are primarily for the economically disadvantaged in Gujarat, India, in October and November 2013. Of the 219 women who completed a self-administered survey, 167 participants, who had ever been married and indicated whether they had been abused by their spouse or not, were included in analysis. More than 60% of the participants experienced IPV, childhood abuse, and/or abuse from in-laws, often with multiple types of abuse. Physical abuse is a major issue for IPV, childhood abuse, and in-law abuse. Emotional abuse potentially happens along with physical and/or sexual abuse. Abuse from in-laws requires greater attention because all types of abuse from in-laws were associated with IPV. Community health centers should provide abuse prevention and intervention programs that have involvement of family members as well as women who are at risk of being abused. © The Author(s) 2015.",abuse from in-laws; childhood abuse; community health centers; cultural contexts; India; intimate partner violence,"Panjab University, Chandigarh, India",English

Some patients are known to achieve complete remission while others go on to develop independent schizophrenia or mood disorders. Aims To study the long-term course of CIP and factors influencing it. Method Patients diagnosed as CIP (ICD 10: F12.5), admitted at NIMHANS, a tertiary neuropsychiatry centre at Bangalore, over the past 10 years were identified from medical records. 200 case records were identified and screened in detail. 57 met inclusion criteria and 35 patients could be followed up. Mean follow up duration was 5.75 years. Results Patients who completely abstained from cannabis after the 1st episode had no relapse of psychiatric illness. They showed marked improvement in socio-occupational functioning as well. All those who relapsed to cannabis use had a recurrence of illness. Half the patients with predominantly non-affective psychosis progressed to an independent psychiatric disorder; while only 7.7% patients with predominantly affective psychosis developed an independent disorder (p = 0.01). Besides this, early onset of cannabis use (≤18 years), younger age at onset of 1 st episode, positive family history of psychiatric illness, being unmarried and lower socio-economic status were associated with poor prognosis. Abstinence later in the course of illness did not improve outcome significantly. Conclusion Abstaining from cannabis early in the course of illness is critical for good recovery. The course of CIP is variable and categorising CIP into affective vs. non-affective psychosis can be useful in clinical practice. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cannabis; Cannabis induced psychosis; Follow up; Long term course; Substance induced psychosis,"Center for the Understanding of Social Processes, University of Neuchâtel, A.

Synthetic measures of multidimensional concepts such as well-being are, therefore, needed. This paper provides a systematic comparison of three methodological approaches applicable in a top-down perspective to construct a synthetic multidimensional measure of well-being using the same theoretical framework and the same data. The three methodologies used are the confirmatory factor analysis, the Alkire and Foster counting approach and the posetic approach. The first two methodologies belong to the family of composite indicators, the most common way to synthetize multidimensional information. The third was developed in order to deal with the construction of composite indicators’ two major issues, namely weighting and aggregating. The main contribution of this paper is methodological; it aims at discussing the advantages and drawbacks of the three methodologies, and at identifying their similarities and specificities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Aggregation; Alkire and Foster counting approach; Confirmatory factor analysis; Deprivation; Posetic approach; Quality of life; Weighting,"Medical Research Department, Bhaktivedanta Hospital and Research Institute, Mumbai, India",English

The participants were randomized either to receive spiritual care or not and Hamilton anxiety rating scale-A (HAM-A), Hamilton depression rating scale-D (HAM-D), WHO-quality of life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) and Functional assessment of chronic illness therapy–Spiritual well-being (FACIT-Sp) were assessed before therapy and two follow-ups at 3 and 6 week. However, with regard to the spiritual care therapy group, statistically significant differences were observed in both HAM-A and HAM-D scales between the baseline and visit 2 (p < 0.001), thus significantly reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed for any of the scales during the follow-up periods for the control group of participants. When the scores were compared between the study groups, HAM-A, HAM-D and FACIT-Sp 12 scores were significantly lower in the interventional group as compared to the control group at both third and sixth weeks.

Chakraborty S.,Using narratives in creativity research: Handling the subjective nature of creative process,2017,Qualitative Report,"For most of us, creative processes are those which can produce outcomes that are capable of being judged as creative. The outcome-centric recognition of creativity has heavily downplayed the process-perspective of creativity in organizations. Influenced significantly by individual and social subjectivities, creative processes are difficult to enquire on the basis of positivist approaches presently dominating creativity research. Use of narrative methodology in creativity research is proposed as a strategy for not just handling the subjectivities but also for making meaning from them as well as from participants’ emotions. Antenarratives can help to enrich the narrated storyline, and personal narratives of the researcher allows to tie back the subjectivities through co-created meanings. The article aspires to invigorate attention towards the foundations of creativity research that has offered little scope for research paradigms that are beyond the objective-positivist tradition. Consequently, it urges the research community to seek suitable methodologies like the narrative which promises to explore the process-perspective of creativity and enlarge our organizational understanding of creativity. © 2017, Saikat Chakraborty and Nova Southeastern University.",Antenarrative; Co-creation; Creative process; Creativity; Narrative; Self and subjectivity,"Department of Psychiatry, Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, Kalwa, Thane, Maharashtra, India; Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, A/401, Charmee Enclave, Service Road, Vile Parle (East), Kalwa, Thane Mumbai, Maharashtra  400 057, India; Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Rajiv Gandhi Medical College, Kalwa, Thane, Maharashtra, India",English

We assessed 100 PLWHAs and diagnosed depression using ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Results: The prevalence of depression was 30% in this sample. Female gender, lack of family support, and HIV-positive status of the spouse were associated with depression in this study. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed lack of family support significantly associated with depression.

Studies comparing psychiatric morbidity in IBS with healthy controls have reported contrasting findings. The current study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with IBS in comparison to healthy controls and to explore the relationship, if any, of anxiety and depression with various subtypes of IBS. Materials and Methods: Fifty consecutive patients of IBS (diagnosed as per Rome III criteria) between 18 and 65 years of age and fifty age- and sex-matched healthy controls were assessed for the presence of anxiety and depression using Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), respectively. Results: The patient group scored higher than controls (P &lt; 0.001) in both HAMA and HAMD scores. The HAMA scores were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) in the severe IBS group compared to those with moderate IBS. HAMA scores predicted 25.6% (R2 = 0.256) of variance in IBS severity scores. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of HAMD scores. Conclusion: The high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression in IBS samples in our study provides evidence in favor of proper screening for these disorders in gastrointestinal clinics.

"Basak S., Basu P., Avittathur B., Sikdar S.",A game theoretic analysis of multichannel retail in the context of “showrooming”,2017,Decision Support Systems,"“Showrooming” as a market phenomenon in multichannel retailing has grown in importance over the last few years. Consumers nowadays use the brick-and-mortar store to research about a product before purchasing it online. This leads to the offline stores being converted into showrooms for the online retailers. Therefore, popular notion suggests that showrooming should benefit the online retailer. In this paper, our objective is to analyze multichannel retailing under showrooming and determine the veracity of the popularly held belief. We develop a series of game theoretic models that involve a traditional retailer and an online retailer under showrooming. We determine optimal pricing strategies for each player and also the sales effort expended by the traditional retailer based on the interplay of “power” dynamics, market potential and the impact of showrooming. Our results indicate that profit for the traditional as well as the online retailer decreases with rising levels of showrooming. Hence, high levels of showrooming are not beneficial from the perspective of the online retailer. Thus, contrary to popular intuition, lessening of showrooming benefits not only the traditional retailer but also the online retailer. Nevertheless, from the consumer's point of view showrooming is beneficial as it leads to overall reduction in retail prices. We also analyze the viability of a click-and-mortar model as a strategy of the traditional retailer to counter the threat of showrooming. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brick-and-mortar; Click-and-mortar; E-commerce; Game theory; Multichannel retail; Showrooming,"Department of Industrial Chemistry, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, 630 003, India; Department of Nanoenergy Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, 609-735, South Korea",English

The fluorescence band intensity was found to increase with concomitant blue-shift with gradual addition of different surfactants. All the experimental results suggest that the probe molecule resides in the micelle-water interface rather than going into the micellar core. However, the penetration is more towards the micellar hydrocarbon core in nonionic surfactant (TX-100) while comparing with ionic surfactants (SDS and CTAB). Several mean microscopic properties such as critical micelle concentration, polarity parameters and binding constant were calculated in presence of different surfactants. The decrease in nonradiative decay rate constants in micellar environments indicates restricted motion of the probe inside the micellar nanocages with increasing fluorescence emission intensity and quantum yields. Further in this work, we also investigated the interaction behavior of the probe with different proteins at low concentrations under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4). Stern–Volmer analysis of the tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence quenching data in presence of probe reveals Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv) as well as bimolecular quenching rate constant (Kq).

"Erande Y., Warde U., Sekar N.",Investigation of NLO Properties of Fluorescent BORICO Dyes: a Comprehensive Experimental and Theoretical Approach,2017,Journal of Fluorescence,"BORICO dyes with N, N-diethyl as a strong donor and BF2 complexed iminocoumarin six member core as strong acceptor are investigated as an efficient non linear optical chromophores. Extended π-conjugation over iminocoumarin moiety is useful to make ICT character of BORICO dyes more significant and is established on the scale of Generalised Mulliken Hush analysis scale. Bond length alternation and bond order alternation values for three BORICO chromophores estimates the cyanine like framework for optimal non linear optical response. The frontier molecular orbital diagrams obtained from density functional theory calculations shows that there is charge transfer from donor to accepter as well as effective overlap between them making the basis for optimal NLO response of BORICO chromophores. The theoretical values of linear and non linear optical responses for three BORICO NLOphores obtained by using three different functionals B3LYP, CAMB3LYP and BHandHLYP with 6-311+g(d,p) basis set are quite consistent for the values of static dipole moment (μ), linear polarizability (α) and first hyperpolarizability (β). However in case of the γ values calculation, compare to the similar values obtained by CAMB3LYP and BHandHLYP functionals, B3LYP overestimates the same. The vibrational motions play decisive role in the overall non linear optical properties of BORICO chromophores. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",BORICO; Charge transfer; Hyperpolarizability; NLOphore,"Department of Studies in Physics, Karnatak University, Dharwad, Karnataka  580003, India; P.

The absorption and emission spectra for above said molecules were recorded in different solvents at room temperature in order to calculate their ground and excited state dipole moments. The ground (μg) and excited state dipole (μe) moments of these coumarin derivatives were calculated using Lippert’s, Bakshiev’s and Kawski-Chamma-Viallet’s equations by the solvatochromic shift method, which involves a variation of Stokes shift with the solvent dielectric constant and refractive index. Ground state dipole moments (μg) were also calculated from the Guggenheim method using the dielectric constant and refractive index of the solute molecule. The value of ground state dipole moment obtained from these two methods is well correlated. Further, it is notified that the excited state dipole moment is larger than the ground state dipole moment for all three solute molecules. It inferred that the excited state for above said molecules is more polar than the ground state. The present investigations may shine in the design of nonlinear optical materials.

"Tarai M., Mishra A.K.",Application of Multivariate Curve Resolution–Alternate Least Square Technique on Extracting Pure Spectral Components from Multiple Emitting Systems: a Case Study,2017,Journal of Fluorescence,"Multiple emitting components in a fluorophoric system often produce complicated emission spectra. Extracting the individual spectral information from the composite spectra is important in order to comprehend the photophysical processes occurring in the multifluorophoric systems. Although the combination of Principal Component Analysis and Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternate Least Square (PCA/MCR-ALS) technique is a well-known approach for curve deconvolution, its applicability in the spectral deconvolution of vibronically and electronically mixed up emitting systems as well as systems merged up with multiple electronic bands without a priori knowledge of the individual emitting species, is not properly studied. The present work highlights the strength of PCA/MCR-ALS in retrieving pure spectral information from the set of complex spectra arising out of the regular variation of causative factors that result in the variation of spectral composition. The retrieval of the emission bands utilizing the PCA/MCR-ALS technique has been made without having a priori information of the emitting species present in the multifluorophoric systems and the resolved spectra correspond well with the fluorescence spectra of the individual chemical species. The common curve fitting methods such as Gaussian and Lorentzian techniques have been found to be unsuccessful in providing meaningful photophysical information through the retrieved spectra. A comparative study of the curve fitting techniques MCR-ALS, Gaussian and Lorentzian in a set of complicated emission spectra of (i) pyrene and its excimer, (ii) pyrene and its excimer in presence of benzo[a]pyrene, and (iii) fisetin in bile salt medium is presented herein in details. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",ESPT; Excimer; Fluorescence; Gaussian; Lorentzian; MCR-ALS,"Management Development Institute, Sukhrali, Mehrauli Road, Gurgaon, Haryana  122001, India",English
Sahi S.K.,Psychological biases of individual investors and financial satisfaction,2017,Journal of Consumer Behaviour,"Traditional finance theory is based on the principle of maximization of utility and explains how choices are made by rational people. Although the theory provides numerous insights, observation of actual behavior of people was seen to be different from what the theory predicted. The homo economicus is in reality a homo sapien who has emotions and beliefs that help to filter the content from his or her environment. These beliefs and preferences that arise due to cognitive limitations, presence of emotions, and various psychological motives guide or bias his or her decisions. Much literature states that the biases should be corrected as they negatively impact financial behaviour and individual's well-being. However, evolutionary psychology considers biases as design features of human mind. Thus, biases are not always bad, as at times, these biases can help the individual investor to choose the best course of action from the multiple possibilities and enable committing the less costly mistakes, thereby helping the individual to achieve satisficing behaviour. This paper aims to explore the investor biases and see whether they are related to the financial satisfaction of the individuals. Financial satisfaction is the measure of satisfaction with one's financial situation. The results showed that overconfidence bias, reliance on expert bias, and self-control bias have a positive and significant association with financial satisfaction levels. Association of a few other biases with financial satisfaction was also observed under certain control conditions. This study provides further insights on investor behavior and paves the way for various possibilities for future research.

E-Learning enables instructors to access educational resources to support traditional classroom teaching. This paper attempts to develop a model to understand and predict the effect of individual characteristics (technology experience [TE] and personal innovativeness [PI]) and e-LMS quality determinants (system quality [SYS-Q], information quality, and service quality) on the continuous use of e-LMS by instructors, which is critical to its success. A total of 219 instructors using MOODLE responded to the survey. The structural equation model (SEM) was employed to test the proposed research model. The SEM results showed that SYS-Q, PI, service quality, and TE have a statistically significant influence on continuous usage of e-LMS by instructors. Furthermore, all determinants of the research model were given as input to an NN model to overcome the simplistic nature of the SEM model. The NN model results showed that service quality is the most important predictor of e-learning acceptance followed by SYS-Q, PI, information quality, and TE.

"Burhan M., Singh A.K., Jain S.K.",Patents as proxy for measuring innovations: A case of changing patent filing behavior in Indian public funded research organizations,2017,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"The process of innovation is crucial and essential part of economic growth. Public funded research organizations (PFROs) are believed to be an integral part of National Innovation Systems (NIS) and therefore form an important part of research focused on developing and enhancing national innovation capacities. PFROs have witnessed substantial changes in terms of increased patent filing over the years. Patenting rates and patent propensity have long been used as a well-grounded proxy for measuring technological innovations in the literature. Variant patent filing motives of researchers may reflect a fundamental weakness in use of patents for measuring innovations. Transition economies like India, with characteristics which may differ from those of heavily studied advanced western economies, are the focus of this study. Data were collected from 43 PFROs in India during the period 2005–2010. This study examined the patent filing behavior in PFROs by analyzing various motives that drive the patent filing of its researchers. Negative Binomial Regression Models were constructed to explain whether these patent filing motives impact patent portfolios in PFROs. We observed that only few of them strengthen the patent portfolios. The results connote the significance of taking granted patents, rather than filed patents, as a proxy for measure innovations in PFROs. Based on our results we also derive some policy and decision-making implications for public research particularly in the context of transition economies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Emerging economies; Innovations; Intellectual property rights; National Innovation Capability; National Innovation System; Patent filing behavior; Patents; Public funded research organizations; R&D,"Department of Pharmacology, Sinhgad Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lonavala, Maharashtra  410401, India; Department of Pharmacology, Sinhgad Institute of Pharmacy, Nerhe, Pune, Maharashtra, India; Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Pharmacy, Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat  382 481, India",English

The main objective of the present study is to investigate possible antidepressant like activity of silymarin in experimentally induced depressive behavior in rats. The depressive behaviors were induced in rats by olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) technique. Wistar rats were administered with silymarin at a dose of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, by per oral in OBX and sham operated rats. Behavioral (ambulatory and rearing activity and immobility time), neurochemical [serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level], biochemical (MDA formation, IL-6, TNF-α and antioxidants) changes in hippocampus and cerebral cortex along with serum corticosterone were investigated. Rats subjected to OBX elicited significant increase in immobility time, ambulatory and rearing behaviors, reduced BDNF level, 5-HT, DA, NE and antioxidant parameters along with increased serum corticosterone, MDA formation, IL-6, and TNF-α in hippocampus and cerebral cortex compared to sham operated rats. Administration of with silymarin significantly attenuated immobility time, ambulatory and rearing behaviors, serum corticosterone and improved BDNF expression, 5-HT, DA, NE and antioxidant paradigms in cerebral cortex as well as hippocampus. In addition, silymarin attenuated IL-6, and TNF-α significantly in hippocampus and cerebral cortex in OBX rats. Thus, silymarin exhibits anti-depressant-like activity in OBX rats due to alterations in several neurotransmitters, endocrine and immunologic systems, including BDNF, 5-HT, DA, NE, MDA formation, IL-6, and TNF-α in hippocampus and cerebral cortex as well as serum corticosterone. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Brain derived neurotrophic factor; Depressive behavior; Monoamines; Olfactory bulbectomy; Oxidative stress; Silymarin,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Hosur Road, Bangalore, 560029, India",English

This issue has received relatively less research attention in persons with schizophrenia from developing countries. Methodology In this hospital based prospective observational study, involuntary admission, treatment and coercion experiences among 76 persons with schizophrenia, admitted under special circumstances of Mental Health Act −1987 were studied. Demographic, clinical and assessments related to coercion experiences were completed within 3 days of admission. In 67 subjects, a reassessment was done just before discharge. Results Mean (SD) age was 33.1 (±11.5) years, 47.8% (n = 32) were males and 32.8% (n = 22) were married. 92.5% (n = 62) had absent insight at admission. Mean CGI Severity score at admission was 6.27 (±0.53). Mean (SD) score on MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale at admission was 4.04 (±1.61). This reduced to 2.43(±1.91) [p < 0.001]. This reduction correlated significantly with improvements in global functioning (r = −0.40, p < 0.001), insight level(r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and as well as symptom severity(r = 0.36, p < 0.001). At discharge, 70% (n = 47) patients reported that their involuntary admission was justified. Conclusion Perceived coercion in schizophrenia though common clinical phenomena, it is a dynamic state which reduces over course of treatment. At Discharge, majority reported that their admission was justified, even though they were admitted involuntarily. The study underlines the need for a standardized rule of conduct based coercive practice in psychiatry. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Coercion; India; Involuntary admission; Mental Health Care Bill −2016; Schizophrenia,"Department of Neurophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Multimodal Brain Image Analysis Laboratory (MBIAL), National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Department of Clinical Neuroscience, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Department of Biostatistics, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Department of Neurochemistry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India; Molecular Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India",English

A qualitative study using focus group discussions or semi-structured interviews of 76 participants, divided into 16 stakeholder groups. Participants from five countries (Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Sweden) were included. A deductive qualitative content analysis was conducted to extract meaningful functioning and disability concepts from verbatim material. Extracted concepts were then linked to ICF(-CY) categories by independent researchers using a standardized linking procedure. In total, 82 ICF(-CY) categories were identified, of which 32 were related to activities and participation, 25 to environmental factors, 23 to body functions and 2 to body structures. Participants also provided opinions on experienced positive sides to ADHD. A high level of energy and drive, creativity, hyper-focus, agreeableness, empathy, and willingness to assist others were the most consistently reported strengths associated with ADHD. Stakeholder perspectives highlighted the need to appraise ADHD in a broader context, extending beyond diagnostic criteria into many areas of ability and disability as well as environmental facilitators and barriers. This qualitative study, along with three other studies (comprehensive scoping review, expert survey and clinical study), will provide the scientific basis to define ICF(-CY) Core Sets for ADHD, from which assessment tools can be derived for use in clinical and research setting, as well as in health care administration. © 2017, The Author(s).",ADHD; Assessment; DSM; ICD; Impairment; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Psychiatry; Qualitative study; Quality of life,"Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160 012, India; Department of Psychiatry, Career Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",English

Interviews were conducted to determine the operational definition and perception about non-conformity. Analysis of the interviews revealed that non-conformity is attributed to not abiding by the rules that have been defined or laid out by an authority in a particular context. Scenario-based experiments were conducted, and the obtained data were analysed to reach a conclusion regarding observers’ perception about non-conforming individuals in a collectivist culture. The results showed that non-conforming behaviour leads to a negative inference about status and competence. Also, we found that the attractiveness of non-conforming individuals does not lessen the negative inferences derived by the observers in a collectivist culture. The findings can be extended to devise several communication and signalling strategies to influence the mass behaviour in a collectivist culture, like India.

Management of countertransference has been measured almost exclusively with the Countertransference Factors Inventory (Van Wagoner, Gelso, Hayes, & Diemer, 1991) and its variations, all of which focus on 5 therapist qualities theorized to facilitate management: self-insight, conceptualizing ability, empathy, self-integration, and anxiety management. Existing versions of the Countertransference Factors Inventory, however, possess certain psychometric limitations that appear to constrain how well they assess actual management of countertransference during a therapy session. We thus sought to develop a new measure that addressed these limitations and that captured the 5 therapist qualities as constituents (rather than correlates) of countertransference management that manifest in the treatment hour. The development and initial validation of the resulting 22-item Countertransference Management Scale (CMS) is described here. Exploratory factor analysis of ratings of 286 therapy supervisors of current supervisees indicated that the 5 constituents of countertransference management could be grouped into 2 correlated factors: ""Understanding Self and Client"" and ""Self-Integration and Regulation."" Evidence of convergent and criterion-related validity was supported by CMS total and subscale scores correlating as expected with measures of theoretically relevant constructs, namely, therapist countertransference behavior, theoretical framework, self-esteem, observing ego, empathic understanding, and tolerance of anxiety. Results also supported the internal consistency of the CMS and its subscales.

Absorption and fluorescence spectra of CHP molecule have been measured at room temperature in various solvents of different polarities. From this, it is observed that the positions, intensities and shapes of the absorption and emission bands are usually modified. Experimentally, the ground and excited state dipole moments are estimated using solvatochromic shift method which involves Lippert’s, Bakshiev’s and Kawski-Chamma-Viallet’s equations. Theoretically, the ground state dipole moment was estimated using the Gaussian-09 program. The value of ground state dipole moment estimated using experimental and theoretical methods are well correlated. This inference that the molecular geometry is taken for CHP molecule under theoretical and experimental methods are similar. Further, we observed that the excited state dipole moment (μe) is greater than the ground state dipole moment (μg) which indicates that the excited state is more polar than the ground state. Furthermore, we have estimated an angle between the ground and excited state dipole moments. In addition, we have estimated the fluorescence quantum yield of CHP molecule using Rhodamine B as a standard reference in different solvents. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",3(2H)-pyridazinone; Dipole moment; Fluorescence quantum yield; Gaussian-09 program; Solvatochromic approach; Stoke's shift,"Department of Dyestuff Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, N.

The paper uses transition/mobility matrices and mobility measures widely used in the literature on intergenerational mobility for the examination. The overall intergenerational educational mobility among the young females in India is about 0.69 (the upper limit being 1). The upwards component of the overall intergenerational educational mobility is 0.55 (that is, nearly four-fifth of the overall). Also, the intergenerational educational mobility is slightly higher in the ‘Scheduled Castes and Tribes (SC/ST)’ compared to the ‘Other Backward Castes (OBC)’ as well as ‘Others’ castes. But the upward mobility is substantially higher in the ‘Others’ caste group compared to SC/STs. The upward mobility among the OBCs is higher than that of SC/STs but lower than that of the ‘Others’ category. Also, the overall mobility as well as upward mobility is higher in urban areas. Moreover, there are large inter-state variations with the economically and demographically poorer states having substantially lower overall as well as upward mobility than the economically and demographically advanced states. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Educational endowment trap; Educational mobility decomposition; Females’ education; India; Intergenerational educational mobility; Mothers’ education,"Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar University, K.

"Bindu P.V., Thilagam P.S., Ahuja D.",Discovering suspicious behavior in multilayer social networks,2017,Computers in Human Behavior,"Discovering suspicious and illicit behavior in social networks is a significant problem in social network analysis. The patterns of interactions of suspicious users are quite different from their peers and can be identified by using anomaly detection techniques. The existing anomaly detection techniques on social networks focus on networks with only one type of interaction among the users. However, human interactions are inherently multiplex in nature with multiple types of relationships existing among the users, leading to the formation of multilayer social networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of anomaly detection on multilayer social networks by combining the rich information available in multiple network layers. We propose a pioneer approach namely ADOMS (Anomaly Detection On Multilayer Social networks), an unsupervised, parameter-free, and network feature-based methodology, that automatically detects anomalous users in a multilayer social network and rank them according to their anomalousness. We consider the two well-known anomalous patterns of clique/near-clique and star/near-star anomalies in social networks, and users are ranked according to the degree of similarity of their neighborhoods in different layers to stars or cliques. Experimental results on several real-world multilayer network datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively detect anomalous nodes in multilayer social networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Graph mining; Multi-graphs; Online social networks; Outlier detection; Social network analysis,"Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, 605006, India; Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi, India; Clinical Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, New Delhi, India; Department of Neurobiochemistry, Neurosciences Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi, India",English

While comparisons between socialized wolves and domestic dogs have commonly been used to tease apart these predictive factors, in many cases a single dog population, often pets, have been used for these comparisons. Less is understood about how different populations of dogs may behave when compared with wolves, or with each other, during an independent problem-solving task. This experiment compared the independent persistence of four populations of canines (two groups of pet domestic dogs, a group of free-ranging domestic dogs, and human-socialized wolves) on an independent problem-solving task in the presence of an on looking human. Results showed that wolves persisted the most at the task while free-ranging dogs persisted the least. Free-ranging dogs gazed at the human experimenter for the longest durations during the task. While further research is needed to understand why these differences exist, this study demonstrates that dogs, even those living outside human homes as scavengers, show comparatively low levels of persistence when confronted with a solvable task in the presence of a human as well as significantly greater duration of human-directed gaze when compared with wolves. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Canines; Dogs; Persistence; Problem-solving,"Department of Marketing, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, India; Department of Marketing, McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States",English

However, this relationship has not been empirically tested. In this research, we posit that those who consume “hot” and “spicy” food may be more prone to thoughts related to aggression. Across three studies, we find evidence for this proposition. Study 1 reveals that those who typically consume spicy food exhibit higher levels of trait aggression. Studies 2 and 3 reveal, respectively, that consumption of, and even mere exposure to spicy food, can semantically activate concepts related to aggression as well as lead to higher levels of perceived aggressive intent in others.

Assessing everyday social support, Study 1 showed that Japanese and Americans rely on exchange norms more frequently than Indians among friends, whereas American rely on exchange norms more frequently than Indians and Japanese among siblings. Assessing responses to vignettes, Study 2 demonstrated that Japanese and Americans rely more frequently on exchange norms than Indians, with greatest relational concerns and most negative outlooks on social support observed among Japanese, less among Americans, and least among Indians. Results further indicated that relational concerns mediated the link between exchange norms and negative social support outlooks. Supporting past claims that relational concerns explain cultural variation in discomfort in social support (e.g., Kim, Sherman, & Taylor, 2008), the findings underscore the need to take into account as well the role of exchange norms in explaining such discomfort. The findings also highlight the existence of culturally variable approaches to exchange and call into question claims that discomfort in social support can be explained in terms of the global concept of an interdependent cultural view of self. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",Collectivism; Communal norms; Culture; Exchange norms; Social support,"Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS), Government Medical College Campus, Kozhikode, Kerala  673 008, India",English
"Sadath A., Kumar S., Mathew S.",Sociodemographic Predictors of Psychiatric Disability in India,2017,Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Mental Health,"Psychiatric illnesses constitute one of the leading causes of disability. Socio-demographic variables are expected to influence the extent of disability. However the nature and strength of this influence is not well understood, especially in Indian context. This study was conducted to examine the influence of selected sociodemographic variables on disability in persons with psychiatric disorders. We recruited 723 patients with severe mental illness from 12 community mental health clinics in a South Indian district. The Indian Disability Assessment and Evaluation Scale (IDEAS) administered to measure disability. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the significant sociodemographic predictors for disability. Disability was significantly associated with gender, years of education, occupation, and duration of illness. Patients’ age and marital status were not associated with disability. Overall the model was significant at p < .001 level (F = 15.591). Results underscore sociodemographic inclusive policy and programs for persons with disability in India. © 2016, Springer India Pvt.

Job stress and job satisfaction are interlinked in most organizational settings. The present study aimed to assess the quality of life, level of job stress and level of job satisfaction amongst hospital staff in a public tertiary general hospital. The sample consisted of 110 workers from the hospital across various departments and classes of work. The sample was administered the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire brief version, the Workplace Stress Scale and the Generic Job Satisfaction Scale. The sample was divided as per the department in which they worked and the type of work involved. The scores on various scales were statistically analyzed. It was observed that quality of life was highest amongst those working in psychiatry and the ICU settings. Job stress (p < 0.0001) and job satisfaction (p = 0.0469) was significantly greater amongst psychiatry and medicine department staff. Amongst various groups student nurses had higher QOL scores (p = 0.013) as well as lower job stress (p = 0.04) scores. Job stress (r = −0.4457) and job satisfaction (0.3797) were correlated negatively and positively to the scores on the QOL scales. It is essential that job stress be addressed in hospital staff as well as measures adopted to enhance job satisfaction which may in turn improve quality of life in this group. © 2017, Springer India Pvt.

But relationships are not always a bed of roses. One may find themselves to be inflicting hurt towards their partner. The study aimed to explore the role of positive and negative relationship quality as the mediators of forgiveness (seeking and self) and psychological well-being in romantic relationships from the perspective of the transgressors. Data were collected from a sample of 119 college students in New Delhi, India, who have been in a romantic relationship for 6 months at least and who have hurt their partner in the past. They were administered the Seeking Forgiveness Questionnaire, Heartland Forgiveness Scale (self), Positive–Negative Relationship Quality Questionnaire and the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-Being. The results showed positive relationship quality to be a mediator between forgiveness (seeking and self) and psychological well-being.

"Reb J., Narayanan J., Chaturvedi S., Ekkirala S.",The Mediating Role of Emotional Exhaustion in the Relationship of Mindfulness with Turnover Intentions and Job Performance,2017,Mindfulness,"Mindfulness in the workplace has emerged as a legitimate and growing area of organizational scholarship. The present research examined the role of employee emotional exhaustion in mediating the relationship of mindfulness with turnover intentions and task performance. Drawing on theory and empirical research on both organizational behavior and mindfulness, we predicted that more mindful employees would show lower turnover intentions and higher task performance and that these relationships would be mediated by emotional exhaustion. We tested these hypotheses in two field studies in an Indian context. Study 1 was a field study of call center employees of a multinational organization, an industry in which turnover rates are very high. This study found that mindfulness was associated with lower turnover intentions and less emotional exhaustion, and that emotional exhaustion mediated the relationship between mindfulness and turnover intentions. Study 2 replicated these results in a sample of employees based in major Indian cities and drawn from different industries. In addition, it showed that mindfulness was positively related to supervisor-rated task performance, with emotional exhaustion again playing a mediating role. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings, as well as future research directions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Emotional exhaustion; Job performance; Mindfulness; Turnover intentions,"University of Calicut, Kozhikode, Kerala, India; Government Homeopathic Dispensary, Kozhikode, Kerala, India; Emirates College for Advanced Education, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",English

"Panda V., Shinde P.",Appetite suppressing effect of Spinacia oleracea in rats: Involvement of the short term satiety signal cholecystokinin,2017,Appetite,"Spinacia oleracea (spinach) is a green leafy vegetable rich in antioxidant phyto-constituents such as flavonoids, polyphenols, carotenoids and vitamins. Fruits and vegetables rich in flavonoids are known to prevent weight gain by inducing satiety. The present study evaluates the appetite suppressing effect of a flavonoid rich extract of the spinach leaf (SOE) in rats. HPTLC of SOE was performed for detecting flavonoids. Rats were administered SOE (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, p. o) and fluoxetine (6 mg/kg i. p) as a pre-meal for 14 days. Food intake and weight gain was observed daily during the treatment period. Serum levels of the short term satiety signals cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucose were measured on the 7th and 14thdays at different time points after start of meal to study the satiety inducing effect of SOE. HPTLC showed the presence of 14 flavonoids in SOE. SOE and fluoxetine treated rats showed a significant reduction in food intake and weight gain when compared with the normal control rats. On the 7th day of treatment, peak CCK levels were reached in 30 min after start of meal in fluoxetine treated rats and in 60 min in the remaining rats. On the 14th day, CCK peaking was observed in 30 min after start of meal in the fluoxetine as well as SOE 400 mg/kg treated rats. Peak glucose levels in all treatment groups were obtained in 60 min after start of feeding on both days of the study. It maybe concluded that SOE exhibited a promising appetite suppressing effect by inducing a quicker than normal release of CCK, thus eliciting an early onset of satiety in rats. This effect may be due to its high flavonoid content. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cholecystokinin; Flavonoids; Glucose; Satiety; Spinacia oleracea,"Department of Applied Psychology, Pondicherry University (A Central University), Puducherry, India; Department of Nursing, New York City College of Technology, City University of New York, United States",English

This cross-sectional study was conducted on 291 students (121 male and 170 female) in the 14–17 year old age group, grades IX and XI. The students were recruited from private, public, co-ed and single sex schools. Along with a Structured Questionnaire, the Mental Health Inventory was administered. We sought to investigate as to whether there would be differences in mental health status of adolescents based on age, class, gender and other demographic variables. There were significant age differences with respect to global mental health, psychological distress, anxiety and loss of behavioural/emotional control. Family type significant differences in global mental health, life satisfaction and loss of behavioural/emotional control were also found. Significant differences were observed with respect to global mental health, psychological well-being, positive effects, psychological distress and depression across socio-economic groups. Number of siblings also accounted for differences in anxiety and emotional ties. However, no significant gender differences were observed across mental health sub-scales. Results suggest the need for promotion of mental health awareness and intervention programs for adolescents, their parents and teachers. There is also a need for advocacy in children and adolescent rights regarding welfare, well-being and protection from violence.

"Konold T., Cornell D., Shukla K., Huang F.",Racial/Ethnic Differences in Perceptions of School Climate and Its Association with Student Engagement and Peer Aggression,2017,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"Research indicates that a positive school climate is associated with higher levels of student engagement and lower rates of peer aggression. However, less attention has been given to whether such findings are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. The current study examined whether Black, Hispanic, and White high school students differed in their perceptions of school climate, student engagement, and peer aggression as measured by the Authoritative School Climate survey. In addition, the study tested whether the associations between school climate and both student engagement and peer aggression varied as a function of racial/ethnic group. The sample consisted of 48,027 students in grades 9–12 (51.4 % female; 17.9 % Black, 10.5 % Hispanic, 56.7 % White, and 14.9 % other) attending 323 high schools. Regression models that contrasted racial/ethnic groups controlled for the nesting of students within schools and used student covariates of parent education, student gender, and percentage of schoolmates sharing the same race/ethnicity, as well as school covariates of school size and school percentage of students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals. Perceptions of school climate differed between Black and White groups, but not between Hispanic and White groups. However, race/ethnicity did not moderate the associations between school climate and either engagement or peer aggression. Although correlational and cross-sectional in nature, these results are consistent with the conclusion that a positive school climate holds similar benefits of promoting student engagement and reducing victimization experiences across Black, Hispanic, and White groups. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Multilevel modeling; Race differences; Race/Ethnicity; School climate,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Delhi, India; School of Humanities & Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Mandi, India; Pt.

"Chaudhary R., Kumar P., Chopra A., Chabbra S., Singh P.",Comparative study of psychiatric manifestations among Type i and Type II diabetic patients,2017,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Anxiety and depressive disorders belong to the most common psychiatric disorders worldwide. They are generally seen in individuals who suffer from chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of depression among diabetics ranges from 8.5% to 32.5%, while that for anxiety it is up to 30%. In this study, we try to compare the mental health problems faced by those with Type I and Type II DM. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients diagnosed with Type I diabetes (T1D) and Type II diabetes each presenting to Medicine and Endocrinology Department were assessed with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) for depression and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) for anxiety. Patients were assessed on sociodemographic profile, duration of illness, type of treatment and then the data were analyzed on different domains. Results: On the assessment of patients with HAM-D a total of 38% with T1D were found to be depressed, and 42% patients with Type II diabetes had depression. Similarly, on assessment of anxiety with HAM-A, a total of 44% with T1D had anxiety. In patients with Type II diabetes, a total of 34% patients suffer from anxiety. Conclusion: The study concludes that Type I and Type II are slightly different in terms of associated psychiatric illnesses. In those with psychiatric illness, they do less well in terms of improving their overall diabetes control. The wider implication is that all the patients with diabetes should be regularly assessed for psychological problems.

The objective was to study the stressful life events and perceived social support in patients with adjustment disorder, first-episode depression, and recurrent depressive disorder (RDD). Subjects and Methods: One hundred and forty-six patients aged 18-60 years with adjustment disorder, first-episode depression, or RDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision were evaluated using the presumptive stressful life events scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Results: There was no difference in mean number of total life events and subgroups as well as perceived stress score in the past 1 year between the groups. There was no difference in the perceived social support scale total score, as well as from family and friends, across the three groups. However, the mean perceived social support from significant others in those with RDD was lower as compared to those with adjustment disorder. Conclusion: Stressful life events do not differ in adjustment disorder, first-episode depression, and RDD. Furthermore, the perceived social support was similar across the three groups, except for perceived social support from significant others, which was less in those with RDD. © 2017 Indian Psychiatric Society.",Depression; life events; perceived social support,"Administrative Officer, Oriental Insurance Company Limited, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",English

Nearly all of these investigations have relied solely on samples from Western cultures. In the current study, responses from a cross-cultural survey of 30,470 people across 53 nations spanning 11 world regions (North America, Central/South America, Northern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and East Asia) were used to evaluate whether narcissism (as measured by the Narcissistic Personality Inventory; NPI) was universally associated with short-term mating. Results revealed narcissism scores (including two broad factors and seven traditional facets as measured by the NPI) were functionally equivalent across cultures, reliably associating with key sexual outcomes (e.g., more active pursuit of short-term mating, intimate partner violence, and sexual aggression) and sex-related personality traits (e.g., higher extraversion and openness to experience). Whereas some features of personality (e.g., subjective well-being) were universally associated with socially adaptive facets of Narcissism (e.g., self-sufficiency), most indicators of short-term mating (e.g., unrestricted sociosexuality and marital infidelity) were universally associated with the socially maladaptive facets of narcissism (e.g., exploitativeness). Discussion addresses limitations of these cross-culturally universal findings and presents suggestions for future research into revealing the precise psychological features of narcissism that facilitate the strategic pursuit of short-term mating. © 2017, Faculty of Arts and Sciences in Rijeka.

However, the relationship between bilingualism and cognition is complex, with costs as well as benefits to language functions. To further explore the cognitive consequences of bilingualism, the study used Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, to examine whether bilingualism modifies the age at onset of behavioral and language variants of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) differently. Case records of 193 patients presenting with FTD (121 of them bilingual) were examined and the age at onset of the first symptoms were compared between monolinguals and bilinguals. A significant effect of bilingualism delaying the age at onset of dementia was found in behavioral variant FTD (5.7 years) but not in progressive nonfluent aphasia (0.7 years), semantic dementia (0.5 years), corticobasal syndrome (0.4 years), progressive supranuclear palsy (4.3 years) and FTD-motor neuron disease (3 years). On dividing all patients predominantly behavioral and predominantly aphasic groups, age at onset in the bilingual behavioral group (62.6) was over 6 years higher than in the monolingual patients (56.5, p=0.006), while there was no difference in the aphasic FTD group (60.9 vs. 60.6 years, p=0.851). The bilingual effect on age of bvFTD onset was shown independently of other potential confounding factors such as education, gender, occupation, and urban vs rural dwelling of subjects. To conclude, bilingualism delays the age at onset in the behavioral but not in the aphasic variants of FTD. The results are in line with similar findings based on research in stroke and with the current views of the interaction between bilingualism and cognition, pointing to advantages in executive functions and disadvantages in lexical tasks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Aphasia; Bilingualism; Dementia; Executive function; Frontotemporal dementia,"George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA  22030, United States; MIS Group, Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Kolkata, West Bengal  700104, India",English
"Dutta A., Puvvala A., Roy R., Seetharaman P.",Technology diffusion: Shift happens — The case of iOS and Android handsets,2017,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"The diffusion of technology artifacts is often marked by abrupt events and incremental evolutionary moves, resulting in shifts in diffusion parameters as well as the underlying mechanics. In this paper, we model the diffusion of Android and iOS based handsets, where new models and operating system versions are released periodically. We relax a common assumption in IT diffusion studies, of holding diffusion parameters constant, and find that there are clear breaks in their values at specific points in time. Using the system dynamics methodology, we then develop and calibrate a causal model of the underlying mechanics. Significant events during evolution of the two platforms are matched temporally with the observed breaks, and the changing mechanics of diffusion across the breakpoints are identified using this causal structure. We find that iOS and Android handset diffusion patterns, although superficially similar, were driven by different mechanics. Our study contributes to the IT diffusion literature by (i) establishing the need to test for, and model, shifts in diffusion parameters over the horizon of interest (ii) offering a method to identify changes in diffusion mechanisms accompanying these shifts and (iii) demonstrating that similar temporal diffusion patterns need not imply similar underlying mechanics. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Causal models; Mobile handsets; Structural breaks; System dynamics; Technology diffusion,"Department of Zoology, University of Allahabad, Allahabad, U.P.  211002, India; Department of Biology, University of Waseda, Tokyo, Japan",English
"Pandey S.P., Tsutsui K., Mohanty B.",Endocrine disrupting pesticides impair the neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive behaviors and secondary sexual characters of red munia (Amandava amandava),2017,Physiology and Behavior,"The exposure effects of two endocrine disrupting pesticides (EDPs), mancozeb/MCZ and imidacloprid/IMI of the group dithiocarbamate and neonicotinoid respectively, on reproductive behaviors and secondary sexual characters have been studied in a seasonally breeding wildlife bird, red munia (Amandava amandava). Adult male birds were exposed to both the pesticides individually (0.25% LD50 of each) as well as co-exposed (MIX-I: 0.25% LD50 of each and MIX-II: 0.5% LD50 of each) through food for 30 d in preparatory (July–August) and breeding (September–October) phase of reproductive cycle. Singing and pairing patterns started decreasing from 2nd week to complete disappearance during 4th week of pesticides exposures at both the phases of reproductive cycles. Similar trend was observed in the disappearance of spots on the plumage as well as color of both plumage and beak which turned black/gray from red. Pesticides caused impairment of the lactotropic as well as hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axes as there was increased plasma PRL and decreased LH, FSH and testosterone levels. Testicular expressions of GnRH and androgen receptor/AR were significantly decreased but that of GnIH significantly increased as compared to control. Significant differences among individually- and co-exposed groups were also present. Abnormalities in sexual behaviors and secondary sexual characteristics could be linked to inhibition of HPT axis and/or direct toxicity at the level of hypothalamus, pituitary and testis. In addition, pesticide-induced hyperprolactinemia as well as impaired thyroid hormones might have also affected maintenance of reproductive behaviors. On co-exposures, the more distinct impairments might be due to cumulative toxicity of pesticides. © 2017",HPT axis; Pesticides; Reproductive behaviors,"National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai, India; The Fenway Institute, Fenway Health, Boston, MA, United States; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom; Departments of Epidemiology and Behavioral & Social Health Sciences, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, United States; Institute for Community Health Promotion, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI  02903, United States; Sahodaran, Chennai, India; Division of Infectious Diseases, Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States; Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States; Department of Psychiatry, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, United States",English

Globally, sex workers have become more spatially mobile due to advances in mobile-phone technology. In 2012 in-depth qualitative feedback was garnered from 40 interviews with MSW and four focus groups with 35 key informants (KIs) who had expert knowledge of the local MSW community to inform the design of an HIV-prevention intervention among MSW in Chennai, India. All MSW were recruited during outreach by employees of a Chennai-based organization for MSM (men who have sex with men). The data were analyzed using a descriptive qualitative approach. MSW and KIs discussed the need for intervention content that went beyond basic HIV psychoeducation. They emphasized the importance of addressing psychological distress, alcohol-related risk, and sexual communication skills. Concerns were raised about confidentiality, privacy, and scheduling. Participants endorsed a combination of in-person and mobile-phone-delivered sessions as well as the integration of mobile-phone messaging. These findings served as the basis for the development of a theoretically driven, manual-based intervention incorporating mobile phones. An open pilot assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention with eight MSW. Assessments and HIV testing were administered at baseline, 3, and 6 months post-baseline. Exit interviews were conducted at the conclusion of the intervention. Retention for session attendance and assessment follow-up was 100 %.

The study was conducted in three stages: a pilot study (n = 150), a main study (n = 300), and a validation study (n = 201). The participants were mainly from urban and semiurban settings. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors on both the Sukha and Dukha scales. Our scales are psychometrically robust with high internal consistency (Sukha: α = 0.86; Dukha: α = 0.91). The scales also demonstrated concurrent validity, as significant negative correlations were found between dukha and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences–Positive (r = −0.35, p <.01) and the Flourishing Scale (r = −0.40, p <.01) and positive correlations were observed between sukha and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experiences–Positive (r = 0.53, p <.01) and the Flourishing Scale (r = 0.55, p <.01). Our proposed model also fits the data well in subsequent confirmatory factor analyses thus adding to its robustness.

"Vakeel K.A., Das S., Udo G.J., Bagchi K.",Do security and privacy policies in B2B and B2C e-commerce differ? A comparative study using content analysis,2017,Behaviour and Information Technology,"Security and privacy policies address consumer concerns related to security and privacy in e-commerce websites. As these policies represent only the vendor’s perspective, often there exists a mismatch between the stated and desired policy. Based on transaction cost theory, we speculate that business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce customers use their transaction cost savings in order to obtain varying levels of security and privacy. These differences are bound to be reflected in the security and privacy policies of e-commerce companies. Therefore, in this paper, we perform a comparative content analysis of the security and privacy policies in B2C and B2B e-commerce. Results show that B2B vendors are more concerned about security than their B2C counterparts, while B2C vendors are anxious about intimacy and restriction privacy. Our findings have important implications for e-commerce consumers and vendors as individual and corporate consumers have varying concerns while transacting online. Individual consumers are concerned about maintaining security and intimacy privacy, whereas corporate users are anxious about regulatory issues. Therefore, B2C vendors should incorporate stringent measures dedicated to confidentiality and protection of consumer data as well as enhance intimacy privacy in their security policies, while their B2B counterparts should focus on enhancing restriction privacy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",content analysis; intimacy; privacy policy; restriction; Security policy,"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Deonar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",English

"Singh R.N., Hurley D., Singh D.",Towards identifying and ranking selected types of violence against women in North India,2017,International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice,"The paper is aimed at identifying and ranking different types of violence against women (VAW) in states of Delhi and Haryana in Northern India. Examples of gender-specific violence were selected through an extensive review of the literature. The types of VAW reviewed include the lower economic value of daughters at birth (females being considered a liability rather than an asset), rampant female feticides aided by proliferation of often illegal prenatal diagnoses, maternal morbidity, and mortality rates, physical and emotional abuse and neglect of female children, “honour” killing of women, exclusion and deprivation of women from medical treatment and nutrition, their subjection to assaults and rape (including marital rape), insufficient compliance to women’s legal rights of inheritance, arranging early marriages of girls, dowry deaths, female sexual harassment, and intimidation in community and workplace, female trafficking and prostitution, and so forth. The conceptual frame of reference used for the study was provided by the culturally sanctioned legitimation of the patriarchal system of Indian family as well as by people’s perceptions and attitudes. Data were collected through the survey method in two phases. A preliminary survey was conducted during the first phase for developing the questionnaire items to be used for data collection in the phase two of the study. The findings of the study are presented and reveal participants’ rankings of selected types of VAW by degree of relative importance. Data, based on secondary sources as well as a non-random sample of respondents, were analysed to assess the various areas which demand immediate redress.

Therefore, we aimed to study the various demographic, clinical and other predictors, if any, to corroborate the severity of OSA in the Indian population. We also validated the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in the South Indian population, thereby assessing its utility in measuring excessive day time sleepiness (EDS) in this population which has not hitherto been performed. We recruited 145 consecutive subjects with polysomnography (PSG)-proven OSA attending our Comprehensive Sleep Disorder Clinic. Their demographic and clinical details were extracted using a standard proforma and EDS was assessed using ESS. We observed that EDS assessed by ESS positively correlated with the severity of OSA, and increasing body mass index (BMI) but not with age. We also noted that men were more prone to severe OSA than females. When individual questions of ESS were analyzed, only 3 out of 8 were able to strongly differentiate mild-to-moderate OSA from the severe group. We concluded that, severity of OSA correlated well with ESS, but not with age and BMI in Indian population and ESS could be a good indicator to assess the severity of EDS. © 2016, Japanese Society of Sleep Research.",Age; Body mass index; Epworth Sleepiness Scale; Excessive daytime sleepiness; Obstructive sleep apnea,"Associate Professor, Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Georgia State University, United States; Affiliated Faculty, Center for the Study on Stress, Department of Counseling & Psychological Services, Georgia State University, United States; Education Program Consultant, California Department of Education, Sacramento, CA, United States; Research Associate, Omkar Mission Research Institute, Pune, India",English
"Dube S.R., Rishi S.",Utilizing the salutogenic paradigm to investigate well-being among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse and other adversities,2017,Child Abuse and Neglect,"The long-term negative consequences of adverse childhood experiences are well documented. However, less is known about salutogenesis (well-being) among adult survivors of childhood adversity. The 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were analyzed to assess the contribution of four health promoting factors (physical activity, smoking abstinence, educational level, social–emotional support) with positive health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among adults who retrospectively reported childhood abuse or exposure to other childhood toxic stressors (n=12,032) and separately for adults who reported childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Outcomes examined included positive self-rated health (good/very good/excellent); mentally unhealthy days (MUDS) and physically unhealthy days (PUDS) in the past 30 days. After controlling for demographic characteristics and existing health conditions, physical activity (p<.05), smoking abstinence (p<.05), education of high school or greater (p<.05), and social–emotional support (p<.05) were associated with positive HRQoL outcomes among adult survivors of childhood adversity and adult survivors of CSA. Each unit increase of the health promoting factor score (0–4) resulted in adjusted odds ratio of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3–2.4) for self-rated health and 1.6 (95%CI: 1.1–2.6) for <14 PUDs among male CSA survivors; among female survivors the adjusted odds ratios were 2.4 (95% CI: 1.8–3.2) for self-rated health, 2.3 (95% CI: 1.7–3.1) for <14 MUDs, and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.6–3.0) for <14 PUDs.

"Banerjee S., Bhattacharyya S., Bose I.",Whose online reviews to trust? Understanding reviewer trustworthiness and its impact on business,2017,Decision Support Systems,"Why do top movie reviewers receive invitations to exclusive screenings? Even popular technology bloggers get free new gadgets for reviewing. How much do these reviewers really matter for businesses? While the impact of online reviews on sales of products and services has been well established, not much literature is available on impact of reviewers for businesses. Source credibility theory expounds how a communication's persuasiveness is affected by the perceived credibility of its source. So, perceived trustworthiness of reviewers should influence acceptance of reviews, and consequently should have an indirect impact on sales. Using local business review data from Yelp.com, this paper successfully tests the premise that reviewer trustworthiness positively moderates the impact of review-based online reputation on business patronages. Given the importance of reviewer trustworthiness, the next logical question is – how to estimate and predict it, if no direct proxy is available? We propose a theoretical model with several reviewer characteristics (positivity, involvement, experience, reputation, competence, sociability) affecting reviewer trustworthiness, and find all factors to be significant using the robust regression method. Further, using these factors, a predictive classification of reviewers into high and low level of potential trustworthiness is done using logistic regression with nearly 83% accuracy. Our findings have several implications - firstly, businesses should focus on building a good review-based online reputation; secondly, they should encourage top trustworthy reviewers to review their products and services; and thirdly, trustworthy reviewers could be identified and ranked using reviewer characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Electronic word-of-mouth; Online reviewers; Online reviews; Online trust; Predictive model; Regression analysis; Reviewer characteristics; Trustworthiness; Yelp,"Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India; Department of Neuroimaging and Interventional Radiology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India",English

Materials and methods: The study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad. Fifty consecutive patients with schizophrenia and OCD and their primary caregivers were assessed. Burden of care was assessed using the Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS). Psychiatric morbidity was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). The data were analyzed with SPSS, chi-squared test, t-test and Pearson correlation. Results: Burden of care was higher in caregivers of schizophrenia patients in 5 domains - financial burden, disruption of family routine, disruption of family leisure, disruption of family interaction and effect on physical health. However, a statistically significant higher score was observed only for the domain of disruption of family routine. Caregivers of patients with schizophrenia had higher psychiatric morbidity but anxiety and insomnia were significantly higher in caregivers of patients with OCD. Suicidality was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group caregivers. Spouses in the schizophrenia group had higher burden and distress. As family burden increased, psychiatric morbidity in caregiver also increased.

Questionnaires administered were revised NEO personality inventory (NEO-PI-R), alcohol use disorders identification test, and advanced warning of alcohol relapse (AWARE). Results: Out of 99 recruited participants (92% males) with mean age of 37 (±8.36) years, 82 (82.8%) patients were followed up to 3 months. E4 (activity) facet of the extraversion domain in the NEO-PI-R significantly correlated with the baseline drinking scores (r = 0.204, P = 0.042, n = 99) and AWARE scores (r = 0.276, P = 0.043, n = 54). There was a significant negative correlation between the E2 (gregariousness) facet and satisfaction with life scores (r = -0.211, P = 0.036, n = 99). Age at first drink was significantly lower among relapsers (P = 0.021). Conclusion: Our study suggests that factors related to extraversion, specifically, high activity might be associated with higher drinking as well as higher risk of alcohol relapse. Predicting alcohol relapse by studying the personality traits would help clinicians in improving treatment outcomes. © 2017 Indian Psychiatric Society.",Alcohol dependence; extraversion; personality; relapse; revised NEO personality inventory,"Department of Psychiatry, Gian Sagar Medical College and Hospital, Ram Nagar, Patiala, Punjab, India",English

This report describes the case of a patient with alcohol dependence presenting with behavioral changes and eating disorder following frontal lobe trauma. A 42-year-old male, premorbidly well-adjusted presented with alcohol use in dependent pattern for years. He sustained a subdural hematoma in the frontal lobe following a road traffic accident 10 years back. Post-TBI, the patient, started having low frustration tolerance, aggressive outbursts, disinhibition, difficulty in persisting with tasks, apathy, amotivation, and craving for food with inability to control intake on the sight of food. On testing, a deficit in frontal lobe functions was seen. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed large areas of gliosis and encephalomalacia involving both frontal lobes with parenchymal loss. Eating disorders have been reported after TBI.

Falls are a common cause of morbidity in these patients. Identifying subclinical involvement of these parameters might serve as a tool in differential analysis of these distinct parameters involved in these conditions and also help in planning preventive strategies to prevent falls. Patients and Methods: Eight patients in age and gender matched patients in each group were compared with normal controls. Standardizes methods of gait and balance aseesment were done in all persons. Results: Results revealed subclinical involvement of gait and balancesin all groups specially during divided attention. The parameters were significantly more affected in patients. Patients with AD and FTD had involement of over all ambulation index balance more affected in AD patients FTD patients showed step cycle, stride length abnormalities. Discussion: There is balance and gait involvement in normal ageing as well as patients with AD and FTD. The pattern of involvement in AD correlates with WHERE pathway involvement and FTD with frontal subcortical circuits involvement. Conclusion: Identification the differential patterns of involvement in subclinical stage might help to differentiate normal ageing and the different types of cortical dementias. This could serve as an additional biomarker and also assist in initiating appropriate training methods to prevent future falls. © 2017 Indian Psychiatric Society.",Alzheimer disease; balance impairment; frontotemporal dementia; gait impairment; posturography,"Department of Psychology, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, University of Delhi, Lajpat Nagar IV, New Delhi, 110024, India",English
Bansal P.,Researching the Use of Psychoanalysis in Narrative Inquiries,2017,Psychological Studies,"Human lives are inherently storied. It is the story or narrative of life which allows for arriving at “meanings”, “feel”, “sense” of our and others’ lives. The present article is abstracted from a psychoanalytically informed, qualitative research work endeavouring to explore and understand identity dynamics in the lives of young men and women. It is an attempt to provide insights into the psychoanalytic methodology of studying lives. It tries to respond to the methodology-related concerns like: How does the researcher understand the participant’s communication? What is the role of theory in research? Does the participant speak in a singular voice? Is it possible to map through the participant’s biography, a cultural biography as well? These concerns are addressed through a life story of an Indian young man interviewed as a part of a research project and interweaving it with available models of interpretations. In doing so, the author has retained and reflected a self-reflexive consciousness. The article, rather than engaging in theoretical debates, presents a researcher’s meaning-making journey of reaching questions and finding answers. It also provides an overview of the utility of psychoanalysis for qualitative research. © 2017, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Biographical gestalt; Empathy; Multivocality; Narrative research; Psychoanalysis; Reflexivity,"Department of Pathology, Pt BDS PGIMS, University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, India; Department of Oral Pathology, PGIDS, University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, India",English

TFLs are seen more frequently in males between 10 and 74 years of age. The usual site of involvement is the head and neck region, but rarely the extremities may be involved. Coexisting fibrosclerotic processes have been reported including retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing mediastinal fibrosis, and orbital pseudotumors. The etiology of this poorly understood entity remains unknown. Possible suggestions include exaggerated responses or autoimmune reactions to any chronic infection. The clinical and radiological appearance of TFLs is that of malignancy, but histopathology reveals them to be a benign process broadly classified under non-neoplastic, fibroinflammatory proliferations. The treatment strategies for these lesions are not well defined and variable and include steroids, surgery, and radiotherapy either alone or in combination. TFLs, albeit not fatal, have a high recurrence rate; patients should, therefore, be kept on long-term follow-up.

"Majumder A., Ray R.",Estimates of Spatial Prices in India and Their Sensitivity to Alternative Estimation Methods and Choice of Commodities,2017,Social Indicators Research,"This paper provides Indian evidence on sub-national PPPs that point to considerable spatial price heterogeneity within the country, based on Indian National Sample Survey (NSS) data. The prices of various commodities have been generated from the household specific unit values obtained from the information on expenditures and quantities from the NSS unit records. This paper shows that the CPD model, proposed in the cross country context, can be adapted to the household context to estimate spatial prices in the intra country context. The proposed CPD based model is shown to be formally equivalent to certain well known fixed weight price indices under certain parametric configurations. The empirical contribution includes a systematic comparison between the spatial price indices from alternative models, namely the CPD and utility based models, and the result that the utility based methods point to a much greater extent of spatial price heterogeneity than is suggested by the CPD type models. The results also record the sensitivity of the spatial price indices to the choice of commodities in the utility based approach. The pairwise comparison of estimates suggests that commodity selection may be more important than model selection in its impact on the spatial price estimates, though the latter is important as well. The study provides estimates of rural–urban differentials in spatial price indices that suggest some interesting differences between the constituent states. The results make a strong case for further research on the topic of sub-national PPPs in the context of large heterogeneous countries. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Household Regional Product Dummy Model; QAIDS; Spatial price index; Sub-national PPP,"Centre for Cognitive Science, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gandhinagar, India; Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Management Indore, Indore, India",English

In order to clarify the effect of lighting on self-disclosure, two experiments were conducted with reported willingness to disclose (Experiment 1) as well as actual disclosure (Experiment 2) on a range of topics like social issues, body, money, work, and personality. While quite a handful of studies have reported differences in disclosure from very subtle environmental lighting manipulations, in both experiments we could not find any effect of ambient room lighting conditions on self-disclosure.

Yet, there is a dearth of studies that inquire maternal spiritual health and its potential manifestation through the mother–child bond. Since associations between spiritual health, resilience and psychological well-being have been established through literature, it would be interesting to study how spiritual health of a mother might be a potential source of influence in the life of her child. The current study inquires whether maternal spiritual health can predict psychological well-being and resilience in her young adult. Sample data for the study were collected from 205 families (205 mothers along with their respective young adults, N = 410).

However, whether apraxic patients learn to develop new representations with training is not well understood. We studied the capacity of apraxic patients for motor adaptation, a process associated with the development of a new internal representation of the relationship between movements and their sensory effects. Methods: Thirteen healthy adults and 23 patients with left hemisphere stroke (12 apraxic, 11 nonapraxic) adapted to a 30-degree visuomotor rotation. Results: While healthy and nonapraxic participants successfully adapted, apraxics did not. Rather, they showed a rapid decrease in error early but no further improvement thereafter, suggesting a deficit in the slow, but not the fast component of a dual-process model of adaptation. The magnitude of this late learning deficit was predicted by the degree of apraxia, and was correlated with the volume of damage in parietal cortex. Apraxics also demonstrated an initial after-effect similar to the other groups likely reflecting the early learning, but this after-effect was not sustained and performance returned to baseline levels more rapidly, consistent with a disrupted slow learning process. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the early phase of learning may be intact in apraxia, but this leads to the development of a fragile representation that is rapidly forgotten. The association between this deficit and left parietal damage points to a key role for this region in learning to form stable internal representations. © Copyright The International Neuropsychological Society 2017.",Internal representation; Learning; Movement; Parietal cortex; Reaching; Stroke,"Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Kozhikode, Kerala  673 008, India; Department of Psychiatric Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro-Sciences, Bangalore, 560 029, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro-Sciences, Bangalore, 560 029, India; Institute of Development Studies, Kolkata, India",English

The role of perceived stress and social support on expressed emotion of carers of persons with first episode psychosis,2017,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Background Caring for a person with first episode psychosis (FEP) is a challenging and distressing task for the carers. The carers’ stress in the early stage of psychosis can increase their expressed emotion (EE) while social support is hypothesized to decrease EE. However, the influence of stress and social support on carers’ EE is not well understood in FEP. Aim To examine how the stress and social support shape expressed emotion in the carers of FEP. Methods Seventy one carers of the patients with non-affective FEP were recruited from the inpatient psychiatry ward of a tertiary mental health care center in South India. The family questionnaire, perceived stress scale and multidimensional scale of perceived social support were used to measure their EE, stress and social support respectively. Results Carers experienced high level of perceived stress, EE and poor social support. Perceived stress significantly increased EE (β = 0.834; p &lt; 0.001) and social support did not significantly influence EE (β = −0.065; p &gt; 0.05). Perceived stress predicted 76 percent of the variance on EE (Adjusted R2 = 0.761). Conclusion The results emphasize high level of stress and EE in carers of patients with FEP that implies the need for appropriate psychosocial interventions to manage their stress. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Carers of psychosis; Expressed emotion; First episode psychosis; Perceived stress,"Institute for Community Health Promotion, Brown University, Providence, RI, United States; Departments of Behavioral & Social Sciences and Epidemiology, Brown University School of Public Health, Providence, RI, United States; The Fenway Institute, Fenway Health, Boston, MA, United States; National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai, India; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

Few studies from India have documented HIV risk factors and motivations for sex work in this population. Between 2013 and 2014, a community-based convenience sample of 100 MSW in Chennai (south India) completed a baseline risk assessment as part of a behavioral intervention. Participants were ≥18 years, and reported current sex work. We report medians and proportions, and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney and chi-square tests are used to examine differences between sex work and sexual behavior measures by income source. Participants were engaged in sex work for 5.0 years (IQR = 2.3–10.0), and earned 3000 (IQR = 2000–8000) Rupees (<50 USD) per month from sex work. Sixty-four percent reported ever testing for HIV and 20.2% for any STI. The most common reasons for starting sex work were money (83.0%) and pleasure (56.0%). Compared to participants with an additional source of income, those whose only source of income was sex work reported more male clients in the past month (10.0 vs. 6.0, p =.017), as well as more condomless anal sex acts with male clients (8.0 vs. 5.0, p =.008). Nearly 70.0% were offered more money not to use a condom during sex with a client, and 74.2% reported accepting more money not to use a condom. Three-quarters reported having experienced difficulty using condoms with clients. MSW in India engage in high levels of sexual risk for HIV/STIs. Money appears to be a driving factor for engaging in sex work and condomless sex with clients.

A dominant narrative therapy foundation that absorbs behavioral strategies can be a relevant style of addressing problems faced by siblings. The narrative frame helps with individual as well as family related incongruent stories, whereas the behavioral frame creates a sense of mastery over the current interactions that can in-turn consolidate new meaning about family life.

"Ghosh S., Lahiri S., Datta N.",Understanding happiness and psychological wellbeing among young married women in Rural India,2017,Journal of Comparative Family Studies,"This study reveals that mean age at marriage for girls was low at around 16 years. Most of the marriages were arranged by parents and meeting prospective husband before marriage is low more so if married off before age 18. Marrying before age 18 years lead to greater adjustment problems at marital place. Psychological well-being of young married women was positively influenced by both woman and spousal education. Marital happiness was found to be lower among women who had three or more children but was higher for women with less spousal difference in opinion, with more spousal support and communication, who had spousal age difference of 6 years or more, and who belonged to non-nuclear families. The study suggests that the child-marriage and lack of education and maturity among women have a direct bearing on the well-being factor. Attaining adulthood before marriage makes women more matured. Then they have a say in selecting or rejection prospective husbands. As per our findings, more than three-fifth (63 percent) women who got married at 18 years or more, had better psychological wellbeing and the proportion declined to 55 percent for women who got married before age 18. Child-marriage is illegal and a punishable offence. But this rule is more violated than observed in rural areas. To stop early marriages and to ensure that young women lead a better life would require specific policy efforts. Spread of education among girls at the grassroots and awareness of human rights have a great role to play in this regard. The solemn institution of marriage should not be a bane to the young girls and their families in general. Giving them scope to earn their livelihoods will go a long way in changing the scenario which will further ensure the well-being and feel good factor of the girls. Counseling of parents is required regarding values of daughters, their education, and later age at marriage. Community mobilization strategies through behaviour change communication may be implemented to eradicate the prevailing beliefs and norms about girl child. The study suggests the need to effectively enforce the age at marriage laws which would increase the age at marriage for girls and reduce drop-out from schools for marriage. In addition, programs should focus on keeping girls in school and preparing them for economic independence, even within the marriage. Vocational training should be imparted to them so that they learn to earn their livelihood. NGOs and other agencies may form cooperatives so that they can sell the products they make at market price. The heartening factor is that girls have begun to protest against child-marriages and several NGOs and police administration have begun to deal will it stringently. © 2015 Journal of Comparative Family Studies.",,"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India",English
Hussain D.,"Conceptual referents, personality traits and income-happiness relationship: An empirical investigation",2017,Europe's Journal of Psychology,"One of the ongoing debates in social indicator and subjective well-being research is concerned with the weak relationship between objective (such as income) and subjective indicators of well-being (such as life satisfaction). Empirical studies show that the relationship between subjective and the traditional objective well-being indicators is weak. This relationship is found to be very complex and far from clear. The present study tries to shed lights behind the complexity of the relationship between income and subjective well-being (SWB) by bringing into the analysis some alternative factors such as heterogeneity in the human perception and purpose of life (conceptual referent theory) and personality traits. Conceptual referent theory of happiness proposes that people differ in their conceptual referent for a happy life and this referent plays a significant role in their judgment about happiness and life satisfaction. Results of this cross-sectional survey based on 500 individuals residing in rural and urban areas indicate that the relationship between income and life satisfaction is not very strong. Furthermore, the relationship between income and life satisfaction is contingent on a person’s conceptual referent for happiness. This study suggests that income seems to have a significant influence on life satisfaction for some people (especially with outer oriented referents) and insignificant influence for other people (especially holding inner oriented referents). Additionally, neuroticism personality trait was able to further explain the relationship between income and life satisfaction. It was observed that the individuals with higher level of neuroticism tend to get a lower level of satisfaction from income rise as compared to individuals with lower level of neuroticism. © 2017, PsychOpen.

Further, the mediating role of knowledge management between high performance work system and organisational performance has also been evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire technique has been used to collect the data from managers (n=58) and employees (n=246) working in telecommunication organisations in Jammu and Kashmir (North India). Data collected have been validated using the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Hypotheses have been tested through structural equation modelling with the help of AMOS and SmartPLS3 softwares. Further, theoretical, managerial and socio-economic implications have also been discussed. Findings: The study indicates that high performance work system positively affects organisational performance. Further, knowledge management act as a mediator between high performance work system and organisational performance. Research limitations/implications: The study has been conducted only in the private telecommunication sector (Airtel, Aircel, Tata Indicom, Idea, Reliance, Vodafone). Further, the study being limited to telecommunication sector can be extended in other sectors also. Practical implications: In order to create superior work system, management should focus on ability-enhancing initiatives such as extensive job training, computer-based training, etc. on regular basis.

"Sathya M., Moorthi P., Premkumar P., Kandasamy M., Jayachandran K.S., Anusuyadevi M.",Resveratrol Intervenes Cholesterol-And Isoprenoid-Mediated Amyloidogenic Processing of AβPP in Familial Alzheimer's Disease,2017,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,"Deterioration of cholesterol metabolism has recently been a frontier subject of investigation in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Though amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) primes the pathological cascade, changes in cholesterol levels and its intermediates, geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate, is expected to have a different consequence on AβPP processing and amyloid-β (Aβ) generation. However, the use of statins (HMG-COA reductase inhibitor) has been widely implicated in slowing down the pathogenic progression of AD, while the epidemiological reports on its biological effect remains controversial. Considering this fact, the choice of drug that could maintain cholesterol homeostasis without altering its biosynthesis may yield a better therapeutic efficacy on AD. Thus, the present study focused on determining the influence of cholesterol and isoprenoids on amyloidogenic-cleavage of AβPP, in addition to resveratrol as a potent therapeutic drug in CHO-APPswe cell lines. High levels of cholesterol were found to enhance the maturation of AβPP and altered the expression and subcellular localization of ADAM10, BACE1, and PS1 thereby promoting Aβ generation, whereas high isoprenoids increased both maturation as well as amyloidogenic-cleavage of AβPP, which was evident through β-CTF production. Interestingly, the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol maintained cholesterol homeostasis and reduced the amyloidogenic burden through its ability to enhance SIRT1 expression and thereby regulating differential expression of AD determinants. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Kaur R.,"Role of attributional, styles and perceived control in control in social anxiety among university entrants",2017,Electronic Journal of Research in Educational Psychology,"Introduction. Social anxiety is a persistent, intense and chronic fear of being negatively judged by others as well as by themselves and being embarrassed by one's own actions. Attributional styles is known as the way an individual explains positive and negative events in life and it has an important bearing on her well being, motivation and performance. Perceived control refers to the belief that one can determine one's own internal state and behavior, influence one's environment, and/or bring about desired outcomes. Socially anxious individuals feel that they lack control over the events affecting them. The present study is carried out to check the relationship of social anxiety with attributional style and perceived control. Method. Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Attributional Style Assessment Testing-I and Perceived Control Scale were administered on 200 female participants from Punjabi University, Patiala. Using correlational design, Pearson's bivariate correlations were performed. Results. The findings showed that there was positive correlation between ability attribution for failure and social anxiety, and negative correlation was found between effort attribution for failure and social anxiety. There was also a negative correlation between interpersonal control, the dimension of perceived control and social anxiety. Regression analysis showed that ability attribution for failure and interpersonal control are significantly predictor of social anxiety. Discussion. The present study was conducted on assessing the relation of social anxiety with attibutional style and perceived control among university entrants. The findings revealed that freshers with high level of social anxiety showed dysfunctional Attributional style and low perceived control than those low on social anxiety. Implications of the findings have been discussed. © Education & Psychology I+D+i and Ilustre Colegio Oficial de la Psicología de Andalucía Oriental (Spain).",Attributional styles; Perceived control; Social anxiety; University entrant,"Graded Specialist-Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Naval Institute of Dental Sciences, INHS Asvini Campus, Colaba, Mumbai, Maharashtra State  400005, India; Consultant-Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Army Dental Centre (Research and Referral), Delhi Cantt, New Delhi, 110010, India; Classifed Specialist-Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Commanding Ofcer and Corps Dental Adviser, 1 Corps Dental Unit, C/o 56 APO, India; Classifed Specialist-Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Military Dental Centre, Barrackpore, West Bengal, India; Senior Specialist-Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Army Dental Centre (Research and Referral), Delhi Cantt, New Delhi, 110010, India; Classifed Specialist-Periodontology, Commanding Officer, Military Dental Centre, Meerut, India",English

The objective of the study was to compare the dental arch morphology of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea-Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAHS) and of those without any symptoms of SDB. Patients/Methods: A total of 600 subjects were included in the study and were divided into two groups of 300 subjects each (390 men and 210 women); Group 1: Patient group; Group 2: Control group. The test and control subjects were well matched for age and gender. A comparative cross-sectional study design was employed and specifc measurements were made on dental study models with digital calipers to ensure precise and accurate measurement of anatomic distances. Results: Analyses were able to detect statistically signifcant changes (P<0.05) in maxillary and mandibular dental arch and alveolar width dimensions. The prevalence of recorded malocclusions in the OSA group in terms of molar/canine relation was also high, with most of the test subjects having an Angle's Class II malocclusion. Conclusions: Indian adults with OSA have a dental arch morphology, which is different from that of normal subjects, of similar age and gender.

Kodwani A.D.,Decoding training effectiveness: the role of organisational factors,2017,Journal of Workplace Learning,"Purpose: Organisations invest heavily in training and development initiatives (Miller, 2012). However, a small percentage of what is learnt by the trainees from training gets transferred to the job (Mackay, 2007). The purpose of this study is to extend previous findings and examine various organisational factors, which have not been studied sufficiently, that influence training transfer. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model based on previous research work is hypothesised and tested. The sample included 123 full-time employees working at one of the major public sector organisations operating in India. Findings: The result suggested that training transfer climate, training awareness, participation and involvement in training decision and training assessment mechanism were found to be positively and significantly related to perceived training transfer. Research limitations/implications: Typical limitations consistent with self-report measures (e.g. social desirability) apply to this study as well. Another limitation was the small sample size. Future studies should assess a large sample size. Future research may assess the extent to which not only trainees but also other training stakeholders, such as trainers and supervisors, feel accountable and responsible for training and its transfer. This would provide a stronger test of the accountability hypothesis. It would also be worthwhile to study the type of evaluation/assessment mechanism that would be more appropriate for training transfer. Practical implications: Organisations should take care of these organisational factors for increasing the transfer of training at the workplace. Organisations can have better control over these factors compared to individual-related variables. Future research studies may also look at the role of evaluation/assessment feedback in training transfer. Finally, the mediating or moderating role of some of the organisational factors can also be considered for future research work. Originality/value: This study is an attempt to add value to the present literature on training transfer by focusing on organisational factors. Most factors studied were neglected by previous research studies. Hence, this is a moderate attempt to add to the transfer of training literature. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Pre-training factors; Training assessment; Training awareness; Training effectiveness; Training transfer,"Touro College, New York, NY, United States; Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ, United States; New York University, New York City, NY, United States; Larsen and Toubro, Mumbai, India",English
"Brock S.E., McAliney P.J., Ma C.H., Sen A.",Toward more practical measurement of teamwork skills,2017,Journal of Workplace Learning,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to take a fresh look at how well instruments commonly used to calibrate teamwork skills reflect the reality of today’s workplace. Given the number of teamwork skills instruments that have been available for many decades, the question was, why still are so many workplace teams not successful? Design/methodology/approach: This practitioner exploration identified insights from a small group of experienced Indian managers on what makes a successful team. It compares these insights to the dimensions identified in one readily available practitioner-developed teamwork skills instrument and to those characteristics identified in the literature. Findings: The match was less than perfect between the criteria these experienced managers used to predict team success and the combination of the dimensions in the literature and what the tool measured. Analysis indicated these managers felt that successful teams indeed required good communication among members (as identified in the literature), but they added the specificity that the element of communication characterized as effective listening was a key contributor to team success. Additionally, they did not just exhibit effective conflict resolution techniques (as identified in the literature), but also relied upon debate, discussion, flexibility, trust and cohesiveness. The findings also suggested the importance of understanding each other’s strengths and weaknesses and of giving credit, which were not included on the instrument used. Originality/value: Given the growing importance of diverse international teams and the continued high failure rate of many teams, there is a need to take a fresh look at evaluating insights of successful team members using the additional lenses of culture, technology-enhanced communications and distributed work approaches. These insights should be compared to those skills that have been historically measured by instruments commonly used to calibrate teamwork skills and described in the literature. If the measuring tools are accurate, why do so many teams fail? If instruments are to be useful in guiding improvement of teamwork skills, they need to calibrate the specific skills that differentiate success from failure in today’s real world. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Team building; Team learning; Teamwork skills instruments; Teamwork skills measurement; Workplace learning; Workplace training,"Business Policy and Strategy Group, Indian Institute of Management Udaipur, F 84, Goyal Complex, Sandesh Press Road, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380015, India",English
Desai P.B.,Values Practices and Identity Sustenance in Dual-identity Organizations,2017,Journal of Human Values,"A dual identity organization refers to an organization having two, often mutually conflicting, self-referential definitions of 'who we are' as an organization (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Values practices are defined as 'the sayings and doings in organizations that articulate and accomplish what is normatively right or wrong, good or bad, for its own sake' (Gehman, Trevino, & Garud, 2013, p. 84). In this paper, I study influence of values practices on sustenance of an organizational identity in dual-identity organizations. I adopted a qualitative approach and single case study method for providing a rich narrative of the phenomenon. I collected data from an Indian software organization involved in both software services and software products businesses. The case data show that values practices manifested inside dual-identity organizations in the form of comparisons of the two identities by internal audiences. The study identifies three types of distinct, but interrelated, values practices: (1) values infusion, (2) collective perceptions of pragmatic alignment and (3) collective expectations of equality and equity. The case data show that ineffective management of these values practices was detrimental to the sustenance of an organizational identity that failed to perform well on conventional performance parameters. © 2017 Management Centre for Human Values.

ADHD, a developmental disorder, persists into adulthood in about two-thirds of the cases. Aims: In the present study, we aimed to explore the prevalence of ADHD and its subtypes in treatment-seeking patients with SUD in an outpatient setting. Secondarily, we also aimed to compare the ADHD scores in the early onset and late onset subtypes of SUD.Subjects and Methods: Adult ADHD self-report scale symptom checklist was administered in 240 patients with SUD. The prevalence of ADHD and the difference in scores in early onset and late onset dependent groups of SUD patients were calculated.Statistical Analysis: Independent sample t-test was used to calculate the mean differences, and Chi-square test was used to calculate the difference in the proportion of cases screening positive across subgroups. Results: Among the 240 patients with SUD, 135 (56.25%) screened positive for 'likely ADHD' and 52 (21.7%) for 'highly likely ADHD.' The scores on the inattention domain and the prevalence of 'likely ADHD' were significantly higher among the early onset group. Conclusions: The results are in agreement with similar studies of larger samples performed worldwide.

Hence, reliable potential biological tests for early detection of PPD are essential. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were associated with depressive disorders and the present study estimated the levels of serum FSH, LH in postpartum depression and explored them as predictive biomarkers in the development of PPD. Methods In this nested case control study done at a tertiary care hospital in South India, 450 postpartum women were screened at 6th week post-delivery for PPD. Socio-demographic and clinical data were recorded and depressive symptoms were assessed using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Out of 450 subjects screened, 100 women with depressive symptoms were categorized as cases and 100 controls were selected from the remaining subjects matching for age and BMI with cases. Serum levels of FSH and LH were measured using direct competitive immunoassay by chemiluminescene technology. Results Serum LH/FSH ratio was found to be significantly (p = 0.02) low in PPD women when compared to normal postpartum subjects. We also found a significant negative correlation between LH/FSH ratio and EPDS scores. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the optimal cut-off value for serum of LH/FSH levels in predicting postpartum depression was estimated to be 0.22 mlU/mL with an AUC of 0.598 (95%CI, 0.291–0.859). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that low LH/FSH ratio after delivery was associated with increased risk for the development of PPD. Low LH/FSH ratio at six-week post delivery can be used as a robust biochemical predictor of post-partum depression. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"Department of Economics, BITS, Pilani – K K Birla Goa Campus, Zuarinagar, Goa  403726, India; Sikkim Manipal University - Directorate of Distance Education, Gangtok, Sikkim  737102, India",English

However, there is a dearth of research that explores the perspectives of long-Term formal volunteers on the nature of changes perceived in oneself as a result of volunteering. Moreover, the linkages between psychological well-being and volunteering have been insufficiently explored. The present study was aimed at addressing these gaps. A heterogeneous sample of 20 long-Term formal volunteer engaged in volunteering across different voluntary organisations in a southern metropolitan Indian city formed the primary sample for the study. In addition, a group of 21 short-Term volunteers, matched on age, income and gender, was utilised for comparison with long-Term volunteers on well-being indices. A semi structured interview schedule was used to explore self-perceived changes attributable to volunteering experience. In addition, a few standardised measures were used to comprehensively assess subjective well-being and psychological well-being. The interview data provided rich descriptions of perceived positive changes in self across cognitive, behavioral and emotional domains. Mirroring these patterns, the quantitative analyses indicated that long-Term volunteers experienced higher levels of psychological well-being (sense of mastery and competence, self-Acceptance and sense of engagement and growth) than short-Term volunteers.

"Mehta K., Ekstrand M.L., Heylen E., Sanjeeva G.N., Shet A.",Perspectives on disclosure among children living with HIV in India,2016,Children and Youth Services Review,"Background Following the widespread uptake of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), young children living with HIV are entering adolescence and beyond, necessitating disclosure of HIV status. However, few studies have described children's experiences following disclosure. Methods We assessed disclosure status among children attending HIV clinics at two tertiary-care centers in southern India. Children who had disclosure were administered a pre-tested questionnaire assessing their knowledge about HIV, ART, experiences following disclosure, perceived stigma and ideas about their future. The association of the children's responses with social desirability bias was examined using a modified social desirability scale. Results Twenty-four caregiver-child dyads participated in this study. They constituted a subset of children who had been told of their HIV diagnosis from a larger study of 247 dyads. Mean age at disclosure was 10.9 ± 2.5 years. Medical personnel were responsible for disclosure to 14 children, parents/caregivers to 3 children, both medical and care personnel together to 4 children and other relatives to remaining 3 children. Disclosure was met with acceptance by one-third of the children. Despite disclosure, five children did not know how HIV spreads, and three were unaware about how infection could be prevented. Notwithstanding their positive status, 20 children felt that they were treated well at school and by their immediate relatives, although 11 children mentioned that they needed to hide while taking ART. Social desirability bias did not play a role in the responses given by these children. Conclusions The rate of disclosure of HIV status among children living with HIV in India was low, even among older children. Most children accepted their status, but knowledge about HIV and ART was inadequate. Disclosure was predominantly performed by medical personnel, rather than the primary caregiver. Incorporating disclosure into the care process for older children is likely to be beneficial, and should be recognized as an iterative process with a need for incorporating cultural sensitivities and a comprehensive approach to health education. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Children; HIV,"Foundation for Research Advocacy in Mental Health (FRAMe), Mysore, India; Northwestern Mental Health, Melbourne, Australia; Medical School, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Edge Hill University, Lancashire, United Kingdom; CSI Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India; Psychiatric Epidemiology, Institute of Psychiatry, London, United Kingdom; International Pediatric Epidemiology, MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; Wellcome DBT India Alliance at Epidemiology Research Unit, CSI Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India; Broadmeadows Health Centre, 35 Johnstone Street, Broadmeadows, VIC  3033, Australia",English

There are limited qualitative data on coercive behavior towards PwD in an LMIC setting. Aim: The aim of this study was to find relevant themes of the lived experience of relatives as caregivers for PwD in view of their use of coercive measures in community setting in South India. Method: Primary caregivers (n = 13) of PwDs from the Mysore study of Natal effects on Ageing and Health (MYNAH) in South India were interviewed to explore the nature and impact of coercion towards community dwelling older adults with dementia. The narrative data were coded using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach for thematic analysis and theory formation. Results: Caregivers reported feeling physical and emotional burn-out, a lack of respite care, an absence of shared caregiving arrangements, limited knowledge of dementia, and a complete lack of community support services. They reported restrictions on their lives through not being able take employment, a poor social life, reduced income and job opportunities, and restricted movement that impacted on their physical and emotional well-being. Inappropriate use of sedatives, seclusion and environmental restraint, and restricted dietary intake, access to finances and participation in social events, was commonly reported methods of coercion used by caregivers towards PwD. Reasons given by caregivers for employing these coercive measures included safeguarding of the PwD and for the management of behavioral problems and physical health. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for training health and social care professionals to better understand the use of coercive measures and their impact on persons with dementia in India. It is feasible to conduct qualitative research using IPA in South India. © 2016, The Author(s).",Caregiving; Coercion; Dementia; Interpretative phenomenological analysis; Low- and middle-income setting; Narrative methods,"Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India; Amity Institute of Psychology and Allied Sciences, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India; Dept. of Psychology, Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University, Bruno, Czech Republic",English

Yoga enhances autonomic activity, mitigates stress and benefits stress-related clinical conditions, yet the relationship between autonomic activity and psychophysiological responses during yoga practices and stressful stimuli has not been widely explored. This experimental study explored the relationship between HRV, mood states and flow experiences in regular yoga practitioners (YP), non-yoga practitioners (NY) and people with metabolic syndrome (MetS), during Mental Arithmetic Stress Test (MAST) and various yoga practices. The study found that the MAST placed a cardio-autonomic burden in all participants with the YP group showing the greatest reactivity and the most rapid recovery, while the MetS group had significantly blunted recovery. The YP group also reported a heightened experience of flow and positive mood states compared to NY and MetS groups as well as having a higher vagal tone during all resting conditions. These results suggest yoga practitioners have a greater homeostatic capacity and autonomic, metabolic and physiological resilience. Further studies are now needed to determine if regular yoga practice may improve autonomic flexibility in non-yoga practitioners and metabolic syndrome patients.

"Savalia T., Shukla A., Bapi R.S.",A unified theoretical framework for cognitive sequencing,2016,Frontiers in Psychology,"The capacity to sequence information is central to human performance. Sequencing ability forms the foundation stone for higher order cognition related to language and goal-directed planning. Information related to the order of items, their timing, chunking and hierarchical organization are important aspects in sequencing. Past research on sequencing has emphasized two distinct and independent dichotomies: implicit vs. explicit and goal-directed vs. habits. We propose a theoretical framework unifying these two streams. Our proposal relies on brain's ability to implicitly extract statistical regularities from the stream of stimuli and with attentional engagement organizing sequences explicitly and hierarchically. Similarly, sequences that need to be assembled purposively to accomplish a goal require engagement of attentional processes. With repetition, these goal-directed plans become habits with concomitant disengagement of attention. Thus, attention and awareness play a crucial role in the implicit-to-explicit transition as well as in how goal-directed plans become automatic habits. Cortico-subcortical loops basal ganglia-frontal cortex and hippocampus-frontal cortex loops mediate the transition process. We show how the computational principles of model-free and model-based learning paradigms, along with a pivotal role for attention and awareness, offer a unifying framework for these two dichotomies. Based on this framework, we make testable predictions related to the potential influence of response-to-stimulus interval (RSI) on developing awareness in implicit learning tasks. © 2016 Savalia, Shukla and Bapi.",Explicit sequence knowledge; Habitual and goal-directed behavior; Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Implicit sequence learning; Model-free vs. model-based learning,"Department of Psychiatry, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, Sayyaji Rao Road, Mysuru, Karnataka  570 001, India; Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, Mysuru, Karnataka, India; Department of Psychiatry, Wellcome DBT Trust Research Fellow, Epidemiology Research Unit, CSI Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysuru, Karnataka, India; Postgraduate Studies Centre, Faculty of Health and Social Care, Edge Hill University, Aintree Campus, Liverpool, United Kingdom",English

People who self-harm experience many problems and typically have many needs related to management of their psychological wellbeing. A positive attitude amongst general hospital staff should prevail with people who self-harm. The principal purpose was to determine student staff attitudes towards patients who self-harmed from a professional and cultural perspective, which might influence patient treatment following hospital admission. The focus concentrated upon staff knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding self-harm. Methods: A cross sectional survey of the hospital staff using a validated questionnaire was carried out. This paper reports on interdisciplinary staff from two large general hospitals in Mysuru, South India (n=773). Results: Findings suggest that within a general hospital setting there is wide variation in staff attitudes and knowledge levels related to self-harm. Whilst there is attitudinal evidence for staff attitudes, this study investigates interprofessional differences in an attempt to progress treatment approaches to a vulnerable societal group. Very few staff had any training in assessment of self harm survivors. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for training general hospital staff in self harm assessment and prevention in south India. The results allow a series of recommendations for educational and skills initiatives before progressing to patient assessment and treatment projects and opens potential for cross cultural comparison studies. In addition, interventions must focus on current resources and contexts to move the evidence base and approaches to patient care forward. © 2016 Indian Psychiatric Society | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Deliberate self-harm; mental health; staff attitudes,"School of Basic Sciences and Advanced Materials Research Center, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Kamand, Mandi, Himachal Pradesh  175005, India",English

Bonnet macaques use four distinct actions during allogrooming, possibly to indicate a particular body part intended to be groomed. These acts were successful in drawing the recipients’ attention to the indicated part, which they began to groom subsequently.

"Mishra U.S., Shukla V.",Welfare Comparisons with Multidimensional Well-Being Indicators: An Indian Illustration,2016,Social Indicators Research,"Problem of making welfare comparisons between populations with multidimensional discrete well-being indicators are well known. Application of a weighting scheme remains a convenient alternative for aggregating across dimensions but not without the limitation of subjectivity in the principle of weighting. Further dichotomous well-being indicators pose another complexity in comparison as regard counting ‘how many’ and ‘which ones’ at the same time. This paper attempts a welfare comparison of population where only ordinal information is available at the micro level in terms of multi-dimensional discrete well-being indicators. This does not involve any assumption either regarding strength of preference for each dimension or regarding the desirability of changes between levels within or across dimensions or the complementarities/substitutability between the dimensions. To carry out such a comparison, we adopt the concept of multidimensional first order dominance that enables us to make comparison across time and between populations based on a series of binary ordinal welfare indicators. This concept is applied to the data on Household basic amenities obtained in the National Sample Survey rounds and comparison is made across Indian states. Such a comparison offers a contrast to the welfare comparison made in terms of the deprivation prevalence across dimensions as well as its temporal changes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Combination of deprivation; Dominance; Inter-dependence; Multidimensional deprivation; Privilege score,"IBS, Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",English

Financial services have been recognised as one of the fundamental services that have the potential to achieve this objective and help move towards a more just and equitable society. This paper attempts to assess the impact of three information and communication technology-driven initiatives in the field of financial services by differentiating them on the basis of service design. This study goes beyond the stated objective of these services and uses Sen’s capability perspective to study their impact across three non-economic outcome variables viz. literacy, service-specific well-being and empowerment. The data for the study are collected from the urban poor across different locations in a large metropolitan city in South India where the three different services are being offered. The study follows a quasi-experimental design (field study) and ensures matching of the treatment and control groups through propensity score matching. The matched data are analysed using an independent sample t-test. The result of the analysis shows that service design plays a key role in increasing service literacy, improving service-specific well-being and empowering end users. The study suggests that the true challenge for providers (government and partner agencies) of these services is in designing a service that ensures a balance of structure and flexibility without constraining the choice of end users through innovative service blueprints. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financial inclusion; ICT4D; Inclusive growth; service design; transformative services,"Department of Psychiatry, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, U.P., India",English

Physiological modeling of retina plays a vital role in the development of high-performance image processing methods for better visual perception. For image processing in medical diagnosis, one has to follow several steps like image preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, image recognition, and interpretation. This work aims at developing human visual system based image processing which stands advantageous when compared with the conventional processing methods. The main aim of this work is to develop a model for retina, which has complex neural structure, capable of detecting the incoming light signal and transforms the signal before transmitting it through the optic nerve. This retinal model comprises of the photoreceptor, outer-plexiform and inner-plexiform layers exhibiting the properties of compression and spatiotemporal filtering in the processing of visual information. The spatial frequency value is evaluated using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) technique thereby enhancing the contrast visibility in the dark area and maintaining the same in the bright area using photoreceptor layer of the retina. Contour contrast enhancement is achieved by modeling outer- plexiform layer of retina and parvo channel of the inner-plexiform layer is modeled to extract finer details of the image. The properties like luminance, spatial and temporal frequencies were considered to develop the human visual system based retinal model. The proposed model is applied to a wide variety of medical images and with simulated results it has been proved that the texture feature values of the processed image are found to be higher than the original input image. Further, this method proves to be more flexible which enables easier practical implementation when compared to that of generic medical image processing techniques. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The precise mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunctions in depression remain largely unknown. On the other hand, enriched environment (EE) offers beneficial effects on cognitive functions, synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. However, the effect of EE on endogenous depression associated cognitive dysfunction has not been explored. Accordingly, we have attempted to address this issue by investigating behavioural, structural and synaptic plasticity mechanisms in an animal model of endogenous depression after exposure to enriched environment. Our results demonstrate that depression is associated with impaired spatial learning and enhanced anxiety-like behaviour which is correlated with hypotrophy of the dentate gyrus and amygdalar hypertrophy. We also observed a gross reduction in the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We report a complete behavioural recovery with reduced indices of anhedonia and behavioural despair, reduced anxiety-like behaviour and improved spatial learning along with a complete restoration of dentate gyrus and amygdalar volumes in depressive rats subjected to EE. Enrichment also facilitated CA3-Schaffer collateral LTP. Our study convincingly proves that depression-induces learning deficits and impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity. It also highlights the role of environmental stimuli in restoring depression-induced cognitive deficits which might prove vital in outlining more effective strategies to treat major depressive disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Anxiety; Endogenous depression; Enriched environment; Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes; Hippocampal synaptic plasticity; Learning and memory deficits; Neurodegeneration,"Department of Psychiatry and De-addiction, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Smt.

This study compared the knowledge, attitude and social distancing practices of the young undergraduate sub-population towards mental illness. A cross-sectional survey was done using a pretested questionnaire, which in addition to demographic details assessed exposure, knowledge, attitude and social distancing practices for mental illnesses. The study included (N = 289; 55% Females; Average age 20.5 years) responses from nearly equal number of students from medical, psychology and other courses. Medical students chiefly attributed mental illness to biological factors while students from other courses perceived mental illness as God's punishment. More medical students believed that mental illnesses can be successfully treated and appeared to have less social distancing from the mentally ill. Males mostly reported stress and brain damage as the causative factors while females attributed mental illnesses to other biological factors. Males were found to be less afraid of a communication with mentally ill and more open to the possibility of marriage with someone suffering from a mental illness. Exposure to information about mental illness led to no significant variation in the studied variables. Thus, demographic variables and the academic course contribute to variations in knowledge and attitude of young adults.

"Rajkumar R., van Schijndel M., White M., Schuler W.",Investigating locality effects and surprisal in written English syntactic choice phenomena,2016,Cognition,"We investigate the extent to which syntactic choice in written English is influenced by processing considerations as predicted by Gibson's (2000) Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) and Surprisal Theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008). A long line of previous work attests that languages display a tendency for shorter dependencies, and in a previous corpus study, Temperley (2007) provided evidence that this tendency exerts a strong influence on constituent ordering choices. However, Temperley's study included no frequency-based controls, and subsequent work on sentence comprehension with broad-coverage eye-tracking corpora found weak or negative effects of DLT-based measures when frequency effects were statistically controlled for (Demberg & Keller, 2008; van Schijndel, Nguyen, & Schuler 2013; van Schijndel & Schuler, 2013), calling into question the actual impact of dependency locality on syntactic choice phenomena. Going beyond Temperley's work, we show that DLT integration costs are indeed a significant predictor of syntactic choice in written English even in the presence of competing frequency-based and cognitively motivated control factors, including n-gram probability and PCFG surprisal as well as embedding depth (Wu, Bachrach, Cardenas, & Schuler, 2010; Yngve, 1960). Our study also shows that the predictions of dependency length and surprisal are only moderately correlated, a finding which mirrors Dember & Keller's (2008) results for sentence comprehension. Further, we demonstrate that the efficacy of dependency length in predicting the corpus choice increases with increasing head-dependent distances. At the same time, we find that the tendency towards dependency locality is not always observed, and with pre-verbal adjuncts in particular, non-locality cases are found more often than not.

"Supraja T.A., Varghese M., Desai G., Chandra P.S.","The relationship of gender preference to anxiety, stress and family violence among pregnant women in urban India",2016,International Journal of Culture and Mental Health,"In this cross-sectional assessment we examined the relationship of anxiety, stress and family violence with gender preference during pregnancy among women attending antenatal services in urban India. A total of 436 women in second trimester of pregnancy were interviewed using the Gender Preoccupation Questionnaire and psychosocial risk factors, namely perinatal anxiety, family violence and stress from daily hassles, were assessed; the relationship of these factors and other sociodemographic and obstetric factors with gender preference was examined. Of the sample, 209 women (47.9%) reported the presence of gender preference either in self or in a family member, of whom 120 (57.4%) preferred a male child. Gender preference was present more often among multipara women (111/220, 50.5%) than among primiparous women (98/216, 45.37%). Overall, women who reported male gender preference were found to have both higher anxiety levels (F = 6.28, p = 0.013) as well as higher stress scores (F = 14.91, p < 0.001) compared to women who either reported preference for a female child or had no preference. Exploring antenatal gender preference both among pregnant women and family members is important. Identifying these stressors during pregnancy is crucial for delivering appropriate services to the women to prevent adverse outcomes in both the mother and infant. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anxiety; Gender preference; India; pregnancy; women,"Centre for Development Studies, Trivandrum, India",English
Mishra U.S.,Measuring progress towards MDGs in child health: Should base level sensitivity and inequity matter?,2016,Evaluation and Program Planning,"Measurement of achievement or progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be suggestive of the issues involved in intertemporal comparison. Commonly, we observe that the measurement techniques such as simple differentials, rates and ratios are employed for comparisons and interpretations. But such chosen measures are insensitive to two very important and fundamental concerns. Firstly, such measures are not differentially sensitive to the base level of the indicator against which comparisons are made to comment on the progress or achievement. Secondly, it is observed that in most of the progress assessments and comparisons, without exception, the focus is on population averages thus ignoring the inherent inequalities therein. To incorporate these two concerns, a method is proposed and an illustrative application is provided to review the MDG achievements in child health across 32 developing countries. The adopted technique is effective for comparison and interpretation of progress and achievement as it augments the principles of equity as well as base-level sensitivity. More importantly, such an improved measure could help the policymakers to identify achievements in a more realistic manner and thus develop a comprehensive vision regarding social and economic achievements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Child health; Inequality; Level sensitivity; MDGs; Progress assessment,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; Amity Institute of Psychology and Allied Sciences, Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India; LM Thapar School of Management, Thapar UniversityPunjab, India",English

Firstly, reliability and exploratory factor analysis was confirmed on a sample of 789 adults for both the scales. Thereafter, the two measures were administered to 608 adolescents. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) supported the unidimensional structure of FS and bidimensional structure of SPANE. A third sample of 786 adults (18–65 years), besides providing further evidence of the factor structure of the scales through confirmatory factor analyses, also enabled the assessment of convergent validity by correlating the scales with Mental Health Continuum and its factors (emotional well-being, psychological well-being, and social well-being). These factors were positively related with FS and Positive Experience and Balance Subscales of SPANE and negatively related with the Negative Experience Subscale of SPANE.

Aim: To characterize the motor proficiency in school children of Kolkata and to investigate association of chronic nutritional and SES on motor proficiency. Methods: Motor proficiency in 843 school children of Kolkata aged 5–12 years was assessed by the Bruininks–Oseretsky Test of Motor-Proficiency-Second Edition-Short Form (BOT-2 SF). Chronic nutritional status was determined from height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) using WHO reference and SES was measured using the updated Kuppuswamy's scale. Results: Children's motor proficiency was poor compared with the reference values. Children classified as severely undernourished and children of lower SES were found to be “below average” and “well-below average” in motor proficiency categories compared with normal nourished groups and children of upper SES. Children's BOT-2 SF standardized scores decreased incrementally with the severity of chronic undernutrition and lower grades of SES. Conclusion: Chronic undernutrition and lower SES are associated with poorer motor proficiency in children. Understanding the complex interrelationships that shape childen's motor skills can help inform the development of health promotion programs and tailored interventions to help children reach their full potential. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of the study was to assess the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) profiles in patients with GID and examine differences in the profiles based on original gender of the patients. Methodology: Twenty-seven patients with GID that fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision criteria for the same were participants of the study. They were administered the MMPI-2 and the scores across various scales were statistically analyzed. Before analysis, the sample was divided into groups according to gender, i.e., male-to-female and female-to-male patients who were requesting sex reassignment surgery. Results: No significant elevation of scores on any of the scales was noted in keeping with the fact that patients with GID usually demonstrate minimal psychopathology. All patients showed elevation on at least one subscale other than the masculinity-femininity subscale. No differences across gender were noted indicating that gender was probably not a determinant of psychopathology in GID. Conclusions: MMPI-2 profiles in patients with GID failed to reveal major psychopathology though the MMPI still remains a useful tool in the assessment of this population. © 2016 Indian Psychiatric Society | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Gender; gender identity disorder; masculinity-femininity; Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2,"Department of Behavioral Sciences, College of Nursing, CMC Hospital, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; School of Social Sciences and Languages, VIT University, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, 632 014, India",English
"Louis P.T., Kumar N.",Does birth order and academic proficiency influence perfectionistic self-presentation among undergraduate engineering students? A descriptive analysis,2016,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Perfectionism is a multifaceted concept. It had both advantages and disadvantages. Perfectionistic traits have been associated with leadership and very intellectual people. The present study is an attempt to understand if engineering students possess perfectionistic orientation and whether it influences self-efficacy, social connectedness, and achievement motivation. Materials and Methods: The present study adopts a random sampling design to evaluate the presence of perfectionism as a personality trait among undergraduate engineering students (N = 320). Standardized inventories such as Almost Perfect Scale-Revised were administered first to identify perfectionists and second to differentiate the adaptive from the maladaptive perfectionists. Scheduled interviews were conducted with students to obtain information regarding birth order and family functioning. Results: Findings from the study reveal that there were a significant number of maladaptive perfectionists and that they experienced higher levels of personal and societal demands leading to a negative emotional well-being in comparison to the adaptive perfectionists. We also observed that first-born children were more likely to display a perfectionistic self-presentation and from scheduled interviews, we understood that paternal influences were stronger when it came to decision-making and display of conscientiousness. Conclusion: The study draws on important implications for helping students to understand perfectionism and to respond to demands of the family and societal subsystems in a positive and an adaptive manner. © 2016 Indian Psychiatric Society | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Adaptive; coping; engineering; perfectionism; personality,"Department of Psychology, Himachal Pradesh University, India",English
Sharma S.,Impact of Globalisation on Mental Health in Low- and Middle-income Countries,2016,Psychology and Developing Societies,"The paper presents a critical review of core social and psychological determinants of mental health from a life-course perspective which operate at micro (individual) and macro (societal–structural) levels in the context of globalisation using the World Health Organization–Commission on Social Determinants of Health conceptual framework. It analyses how globalisation-induced changes implicate social and psychological variables that impact upon inequities in mental health and well-being. Mental health outcomes relating to four core determinants—deepening poverty and inequalities, migrations, rapid and uncontrollable socio-cultural value change and identity diffusion—are focused on. The overall evidence shows that these core determinants have pernicious effects on mental health and well-being often leading to common mental disorders (CMDs). Mental health protection and promotion efforts necessitate multisectoral, holistic, culturally responsible actions that equip people and communities to cope better with stressors created by the globalised world. © 2016, © 2016 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.",acculturative stress; Globalisation; identity erosion; inequalities; mental health; migration; poverty; social health determinants; social values; WHO–CSDH framework,"Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Krishna Institute of Engineering and Technology, Ghaziabad, UP, India; Department of Pharm.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of lycopene on the antiepileptic effects of sodium valproate against pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling in mice. Swiss albino mice of either sex were randomly divided into 5 groups, with each group containing 8 mice. These groups were treated with pentylenetetrazol (45 mg/kg on days 8, 10, and 12 and 70 mg/kg on day 14 day, i.p.); sodium valproate (200 mg/kg, p.o.) + pentylenetetrazol; lycopene (2 mg/kg, p.o.) + sodium valproate (200 mg/kg, p.o.) + pentylenetetrazol; and lycopene (4 mg/kg, p.o.) + sodium valproate (200 mg/kg, p.o.) + pentylenetetrazol, for 14 days, respectively. After treatment, the animals were observed for 30 minutes for behavioral analysis. Subsequently, the animals were sacrificed, and their brain was removed for the biochemical estimations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, catalase, superoxide dismutase activity, reduced glutathione, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Significant pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure was characterized by alteration in the seizure score and latency as well as a significant increase in the levels of brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and a significant decrease in reduced glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels. Treatment with sodium valproate and lycopene significantly restored the seizure score, latency, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, reduced glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and gamma-aminobutyric acid levels near to normal compared to pentylenetetrazol. The present study provides experimental evidence that a combination therapy of lycopene along with sodium valproate attenuated seizure and oxidative stress against pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling in mice. © 2016, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

"Biswal S., Sharma D., Kumar K., Nag T.C., Barhwal K., Hota S.K., Kumar B.",Global hypoxia induced impairment in learning and spatial memory is associated with precocious hippocampal aging,2016,Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,"Both chronological aging and chronic hypoxia stress have been reported to cause degeneration of hippocampal CA3 neurons and spatial memory impairment through independent pathways. However, the possible occurrence of precocious biological aging on exposure to single episode of global hypoxia resulting in impairment of learning and memory remains to be established. The present study thus aimed at bridging this gap in existing literature on hypoxia induced biological aging. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to simulated hypobaric hypoxia (25,000 ft) for different durations and were compared with aged rats. Behavioral studies in Morris Water Maze showed decline in learning abilities of both chronologically aged as well as hypoxic rats as evident from increased latency and pathlength to reach target platform. These behavioral changes in rats exposed to global hypoxia were associated with deposition of lipofuscin and ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria of hippocampal neurons that serve as hallmarks of aging. A single episode of chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure also resulted in the up-regulation of pro-aging protein, S100A9 and down regulation of Tau, SNAP25, APOE and Sod2 in the hippocampus similar to that in aged rats indicating hypoxia induced accelerated aging. The present study therefore provides evidence for role of biological aging of hippocampal neurons in hypoxia induced impairment of learning and memory. © 2016",Aging; Hippocampus; Hypoxia; Learning; Memory; S100A9,"Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences, A.M.U., Aligarh, U.P  202002, India",English
"Mustafa M.F., Bano B.",Glycation of Liver Cystatin: Implication on its Structure and Function,2016,Journal of Fluorescence,"The increased level of reducing sugars and their derivatives in a diabetic condition has been the main cause of protein related complications. The changes in native state of proteins upon glycation induce loss in the function and structure of proteins. This further leads to cell damage and accumulation of immune system inducing AGE formation. Here in the present study cystatin was purified from liver (BLC) through affinity chromatography and was incubated with glucose, fructose and ribose. Changes were observed in the intensity of Trp absorption at 280 nm as well as AGE’s specific fluorescence at 435 nm upon excitation at 370 nm to monitor the formation of BLC-sugar adducts. Protein intrinsic fluorescence showed marked conformational changes when BLC was incubated with D-ribose, glucose and fructose. Glycation with D-ribose induces BLC to misfold rapidly into an intermediate state retaining a low percentage of α-helical content compared to fructose and glucose as revealed by far-UV CD data. Furthermore, a caseinolytic assay of papain in presence of glycated liver cystatin showed decreased activity in the protein induced by these reducing sugars. Ribose had more effect on the structure as well as the function of liver cystatin followed by fructose and least for glucose. Absorption spectroscopy shows change in BLC and formation of AGE’s. These results shows that liver cystatin-cathepsin imbalance is compromised in diabetic state which may lead to improper balance of proteinases leading to cirrhosis or liver damage. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",CD; Cystatin; Fluorescence; Glycation; Ribose,"Department of Linguistics, University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, MD, United States; Department of Linguistics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; Department of Linguistics, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Department of Linguistics, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India",English
"Chacón D.A., Imtiaz M., Dasgupta S., Murshed S.M., Dan M., Phillips C.",Locality and word order in active dependency formation in Bangla,2016,Frontiers in Psychology,"Research on filler-gap dependencies has revealed that there are constraints on possible gap sites, and that real-time sentence processing is sensitive to these constraints. This work has shown that comprehenders have preferences for potential gap sites, and immediately detect when these preferences are not met. However, neither the mechanisms that select preferred gap sites nor the mechanisms used to detect whether these preferences are met are well-understood. In this paper, we report on three experiments in Bangla, a language in which gaps may occur in either a pre-verbal embedded clause or a post-verbal embedded clause. This word order variation allows us to manipulate whether the first gap linearly available is contained in the same clause as the filler, which allows us to dissociate structural locality from linear locality. In Experiment 1, an untimed ambiguity resolution task, we found a global bias to resolve a filler-gap dependency with the first gap linearly available, regardless of structural hierarchy. In Experiments 2 and 3, which use the filled-gap paradigm, we found sensitivity to disruption only when the blocked gap site is both structurally and linearly local, i.e., the filler and the gap site are contained in the same clause. This suggests that comprehenders may not show sensitivity to the disruption of all preferred gap resolutions. © 2016 Chacón, Imtiaz, Dasgupta, Murshed, Dan and Phillips.",Bangla; Filler-gap dependencies; Islands; Locality; Sentence processing,"Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi, Meghe, Wardha Maharashtra, India; Department of Psychiatry, Tripura Medical College, Agartala, India",English

"Pathak A., Srivastava A.K., Singour P.K., Gouda P.",Synthetic and natural monoamine oxidase inhibitors as potential lead compounds for effective therapeutics,2016,Central Nervous System Agents in Medicinal Chemistry,"Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A and B) play a critical role in the metabolism of intracellular neurotransmitters of the central nervous system. For decades, MAO inhibitors have proven their clinical efficacy as potential drug targets for several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Use of first generation non selective MAO inhibitors as neuropsychiatric drugs elicited several side effects like hypertensive crisis and cheese reaction. Therefore their use is now limited due to non-selectivity towards MAO isoforms and inhibition of metabolizing enzymes like cytochrome P450. Development of selective and specific MAO inhibitors like moclobemide, toloxatone improves their efficacy as disease-modifying effects in monotherapy as well as adjunctive therapy. Recently a lot of research has been done to elucidate the pharmacological potential of medicinal plants and their isolated bioactive constituents having MAO inhibitory activity. Herbs containing MAO inhibitors are extensively used for the development of potent synthetic drugs and as safe and effective alternatives to the available synthetic drugs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as depression, Parkinson and Alzheimer’s. In several diseases like Parkinson natural MAO inhibitors prevented the neuron denaturalization by their dual action via enhancing neurotransmission of dopamine as well as lowering the generation of free radicals and toxins. Currently development of selective MAO inhibitors is still under study to achieve more effective therapies by using Computer Aided Drug Designing, Ligand-based models and structure-activity hypothesis. These approaches also facilitate understanding the interaction of newly designed molecule with MAO enzymes and the rationalization of probable mechanisms of action. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",Coumarins; Depression; Flavonoids; Monoamine oxidase inhibitors; Neurotransmitters; Parkinson’s; Therapeutics; Xanthones,"Division of Mental Health, St. John's Research Institute, Koramangala 100 ft Road, Bangalore, 560034, India",English

This paper aims to evaluate and rank the performance of the states in India under MGNREGA scheme. A non-parametric approach, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the overall technical, pure technical, and scale efficiencies of states in India. The sample data is drawn from the annual official reports published by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. Based on three selected input parameters (expenditure indicators) and five output parameters (employment generation indicators), I apply both input and output oriented DEA models to estimate how well the states utilize their resources and generate outputs during the financial year 2013-14. The relative performance evaluation has been made under the assumption of constant returns and also under variable returns to scale to assess the impact of scale on performance. The results indicate that the main source of inefficiency is both technical and managerial practices adopted. 11 states are overall technically efficient and operate at the optimum scale whereas 18 states are pure technical or managerially efficient. It has been found that for some states it necessary to alter scheme size to perform at par with the best performing states. For inefficient states optimal input and output targets along with the resource savings and output gains are calculated. Analysis shows that if all inefficient states operate at optimal input and output levels, on an average 17.89% of total expenditure and a total amount of $780million could have been saved in a single year. Most of the inefficient states perform poorly when it comes to the participation of women and disadvantaged sections (SC&ST) in the scheme. In order to catch up with the performance of best performing states, inefficient states on an average need to enhance women participation by 133%. In addition, the states are also ranked using the cross efficiency approach and results are analyzed. State of Tamil Nadu occupies the top position followed by Puducherry, Punjab, and Rajasthan in the ranking list. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first pan-India level study to evaluate and rank the performance of MGNREGA scheme quantitatively and so comprehensively. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",DEA; Efficiency analysis; Evaluation; Linear programming; Performance measurement; Social welfare,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, 560029, India; Dutch Case Register on Containment Measures located Den Dolder Utrecht, GGNet Community Mental Health Centre, PO Box 2003, Warnsveld, 7230 GC, Netherlands; Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (DIMHANS), Belgaum Road, Dharwad, 580008, India",English

However, we have little evidence on patient's perspectives of coercion and LRA. Methodology: This was a hospital-based prospective pilot study. 170 subjects chosen by computer-generated random number sampling were screened. In 83 eligible subjects, all assessments including coercion assessment were completed within 3 days of admission and in 75 subjects reassessment was done within 3 days of discharge. Results: Perceived coercion as measured by the MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale (MPCS) decreased significantly from 3.72 ± 1.98 at admission to 1.77 ± 1.8 (<0.001) at discharge. This was accompanied by significant increase in global functioning, insight score (from 1.5 ± 1.0 to 3.8 ± 1.1; p < 0.001) and as well as decrease in symptom severity (CGI-S) (from 5.9 ± 1.1 to 1.8 ± 1.9; p < 0.001). Coercion is predicted by family type, employment status, socio economic status, severity of illness and level of insight. 87% patients reported that their admission was justified even though many felt coerced during hospital stay. Conclusion: Coercion is a dynamic state and changes with treatment and care. Clinical care may result in an improvement in global functioning, insight as well as in reduction in severity of illness consequently leading to less coercion. During the time of discharge, majority of patients reported that their admission was justified, even though they felt coerced during hospital stay and agreed for treatment against their will within a safe, standardised coercive practice. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..",Clinical factors; Coercion; India; Inpatients; MHCB - 2013; Patients' perspective,"Department of Clinical Psychology (Health Emphasis), Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY  10461, United States; Department of Psychology, Pace University, United States; Department of Biological Sciences, Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, India; Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research, Cambridge Health Alliance/Harvard Medical School, United Kingdom",English

Employing qualitative methods, in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data from 20 PLS, attending psychiatric clinics, peer support groups and mental health agencies across the city of Mumbai, India. Thematic analysis suggested five main domains of stigma-related stressors: (1) ‘illness’ labeling; (2) labeling, violence and abuse; (3) rejection; (4) job loss; and (5) anticipatory discrimination. Participants responded to stigma stressors by being either helpless or resistant, but there were complex, multi-level factors, such as gender, employment, familial roles and responsibilities, support system, living arrangements, spiritual affiliation and past experiences of discrimination, influencing those responses. Findings explored unique social, economic and cultural elements that intersect with individuals’ societal relations in the post-illness phase and affect overall wellbeing. The study concludes by suggesting implications for research and practice for PLS. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",coping; discrimination; Stigma; support; violence,"Asha Bipolar Clinic, Asha Hospital, East Marredpally, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500 026, India; Department of Psychiatry, Katuri Medical College and Hospital, Eudulapalem, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India",English

"Ransing R.S., Mishra K.K., Sarkar D.",Neuropsychiatric manifestation of Hashimoto's encephalopathy in an adolescent and treatment,2016,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Hashimoto's encephalopathy is usually underdiagnosed and untreated because of complex neuropsychiatric manifestation. We report a case of an adolescent female with Hashimoto's encephalopathy who responded well to a combination of aspirin and levothyroxine. A 16-year-old girl presented at psychiatric emergency services with a depressive episode, menstrual irregularities, and a 5-month past history of thyroid swelling. On clinical examination, she was in a euthyroid state with insignificant neurological history. However, her previous investigation revealed a hypothyroid state. Her magnetic resonance imaging findings demonstrated infarcts in the bilateral gangliocapsular region and left frontal periventricular deep white matter lesion. Ultrasonography of the thyroid and fine needle aspiration cytology confirmed lymphocytic thyroiditis. Anti-thyroid peroxidase (289 IU/ml) antibody titer was elevated (289 IU/mL). Her depressive symptoms responded well to antidepressants, mood stabilizers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and levothyroxine. She remained in the euthyroid state and then in the euthymic state for 3 years. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is steroid-responsive encephalopathy. Most researchers have observed a dramatic response to steroids with or without levothyroxine. A clinician may consider aspirin as an alternative to a steroid in long-term management to avoid steroid-related side effects and contraindications. © 2016 Indian Psychiatric Society | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Aspirin; Hashimoto's encephalopathy; levothyroxine; steroid-responsive,"Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Drs.

A 40-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of a swelling over the left side of his face of 4 years’ duration. On examination, gross facial asymmetry was detected, and a well-defined swelling was noted intraorally involving the left maxilla medially from the mid palatal raphe and obliterating the buccal vestibule laterally. The swelling was non-tender and exhibited dual consistencies: firm in the palate and cystic in the vestibular region. Computed tomography revealed a multilocular radiolucency, which involved the left maxilla, encroached into the left maxillary sinus and the nasal complex, and caused bony erosion. Early diagnosis and treatment are the key tools in managing ameloblastomas, failure of which may lead to a significant deterioration of the prognosis and an increased recurrence rate. Uncommon variants of ameloblastomas have been gaining interest recently. To date, 25 cases of hybrid ameloblastomas have been documented in the scientific literature.

The negative zeta potential of nano probe (−22.6 mV) responsible to adsorb oppositely charged analyte on its surface and further permit to bind nano probe and analyte within the close distance proximity required for efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to take place from donor (PHNNPs) to acceptor (ETS). Systematic FRET experiments performed by measuring fluorescence quenching of PHNNPs with successive addition of ETS solution exploited the use of the PHNNPs as a novel nano probe for the detection of ETS in aqueous solution with extremely lower limit of detection equal to 3.6 nM (3.1 ng/mL). The estimation of photo kinetic and thermodynamic parameters such as quenching rate constant, enthalpy change (∆H), Gibbs free energy change (∆G) and entropy change (∆S) was obtained by the quenching results obtained at different constant temperatures which were found to fit the well-known Stern–Volmer relation. The mechanism of binding and fluorescence quenching of PHNNPs by ETS food dye is proposed on the basis of results obtained in photophysical studies, thermodynamic parameter, energy transfer efficiency, critical energy transfer distance (R0) and distance of approach between donor–acceptor molecules (r). The proposed FRET method based on fluorescence quenching of PHNNPs was successfully applied to develop an analytical method for estimation of ETS from food stuffs without interference of other complex ingredients.

The growth of an inert NaYF4 and silica shell (~14 nm) around the core-NPs resulted in an increase of the average size of the nanopaticles as well as broadening of their size distribution. The optical band-gap energy slightly decreases after shell formation due to the increase the crystalline size. To optimize the influence of shell formation a comparative analysis of photoluminescence properties (excitation, emission, and luminescence decay time) of the core, core/shell, and core/shell/SiO2 NPs were measured. The emission intensity was significantly enhanced after inert shell formation around the surface of the core NPs. The Commission International de l’Eclairage chromaticity coordinates of the emission spectrum of core, core/shell, core/shell/SiO2 NPs lie closest to the standard green color emission at 545 nm. By quantitative spectroscopic measurements of surface-modified core-NPs, it was suggested that encapsulation with inert and silica layers was found to be effective in retaining both luminescence intensity and dispersibility in aqueous environment. Considering the high aqueous dispersion and enhanced luminescence efficiency of the core-NPs make them an ideal luminescent material for luminescence bioimaging and optical biosensors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Band gap energy; Decay time; Luminescent NPs; Optical absorbance; Photoluminescence,"Karnatak University, Dharwad, Karnataka  580 003, India",English

We approach well-being as a multidimensional concept and then focus on three of its dimensions: subsistence, security, and reproduction and care. Working with tribal communities from Kodagu (Karnataka, India), we found positive associations between economic and natural capital and subjective well-being. Nevertheless, the two types of capitals differed on their relative contribution to (a) overall subjective well-being and (b) the three selected dimensions.

Selfies have become the newest technological fad to take over the youth, due to the wide and easy availability of mobile phones. There is paucity of scientific data on selfies in general, and from our country in particular. This study aimed to analyze the attitudes toward selfie taking, body image acceptance, and narcissism personality traits among an urban school-going population in Mumbai. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-two students of 11th standard, belonging to an urban Mumbai school, were interviewed in a single centric cross-sectional study. Scales used were - attitude towards selfie-taking questionnaire, body image acceptance, and action questionnaire (BIAAQ) and Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Statistical Analysis Used: Scores obtained were computed using basic descriptive statistics as well as computerized statistical software. Results: Of the 230 completely filled questionnaires, 54% were males. About 42.6% reported that they regularly clicked selfies of themselves. No gender difference was noticed. On an average, 18.1% girls and 15.2% boys clicked more than 4 selfies/day. The gender difference was statistically not significant (P = 0.5273). Difference in mean BIAAQ between the two genders was noticed to be statistically significant, whereas the NPI scores difference was insignificant. Conclusions: This study is a pioneering/novel/innovative work in the field of selfies. It gives us an insight into the youth's viewpoint towards selfies, which was positive in the majority of the population. A worrisome aspect is the higher body image dissatisfaction among girls.

However, the key for resolution of the disease is good compliance to a gluten-free diet. Unfortunately, the current scenario in India is that either gluten free foods are not easily available or are expensive and often not tested. This is especially true in schools and colleges and smaller towns. In addition, the stigma attached to gluten-free food makes it socially undesirable, and this is made worse by the lack of knowledge among peers, family members, advisors, and even health care providers.

"Kumari A., Singh P., Baghel M.S., Thakur M.K.",Social isolation mediated anxiety like behavior is associated with enhanced expression and regulation of BDNF in the female mouse brain,2016,Physiology and Behavior,"Adverse early life experience is prominent risk factors for numerous psychiatric illnesses, including mood and anxiety disorders. It imposes serious long-term costs on the individual as well as health and social systems. Hence, developing therapies that prevent the long-term consequences of early life stress is of utmost importance, and necessitates a better understanding of the mechanisms by which early life stress triggers long-lasting alterations in gene expression and behavior. Post-weaning isolation rearing of rodents models the behavioral consequences of adverse early life experiences in humans and it is reported to cause anxiety like behavior which is more common in case of females. Therefore, in the present study, we have studied the impact of social isolation of young female mice for 8 weeks on the anxiety like behavior and the underlying molecular mechanism. Elevated plus maze and open field test revealed that social isolation caused anxiety like behavior. BDNF, a well-known molecule implicated in the anxiety like behavior, was up-regulated both at the message and protein level in cerebral cortex by social isolation. CREB-1 and CBP, which play a crucial role in BDNF transcription, were up-regulated at mRNA level in cerebral cortex by social isolation. HDAC-2, which negatively regulates BDNF expression, was down-regulated at mRNA and protein level in cerebral cortex by social isolation. Furthermore, BDNF acts in concert with Limk-1, miRNA-132 and miRNA-134 for the regulation of structural and morphological plasticity. Social isolation resulted in up-regulation of Limk-1 mRNA and miRNA-132 expression in the cerebral cortex. MiRNA-134, which inhibits the translation of Limk-1, was decreased in cerebral cortex by social isolation. Taken together, our study suggests that social isolation mediated anxiety like behavior is associated with up-regulation of BDNF expression and concomitant increase in the expression of CBP, CREB-1, Limk-1 and miRNA-132, and decrease in the expression of HDAC-2 and miRNA-134 in the cerebral cortex. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Anxiety; BDNF; Cerebral cortex; HDAC-2; MiRNA-132; Social isolation,"Department of Chemistry, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700 032, India",English

The study unveils that dehydrogenation in the heterocyclic rings of the studied quinoline derivatives modifies their photophysics radically. Experimental observations imply that the photophysical behavior of the dihydro analogues is governed by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. However, the ICT process is restricted significantly by the dehydrogenation of the heterocyclic rings. Computational exertion leads to the proposition that the change in the electronic distribution in these molecular systems on dehydrogenation is the rationale behind the dramatic modification of their photophysics. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Benzoquinoline; Charge distribution; Dehydrogenation; Intramolecular charge transfer; Photophysics,"Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, A-10, Sector: 62, Noida, 201307, India; Jaypee Business School, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, A-10, Sector: 62, Noida, 201307, India; Indian Institute of Management Lucknow, Noida Campus, B-1, Sector: 62, Noida, 201307, India",English

SAGE provides nationally representative data for 35,125 people aged 50 and over. These reveal large national variations in reported crime fear: for example, 65 per cent of older South Africans felt unsafe on the street, compared to only 9 per cent of older Ghanaians. The paper examines factors potentially associated with crime fear, including age, socio-economic status and frailty, and relates these to different theoretical models of crime fear. Female sex and frailty are associated with higher rates of crime fear across the study countries. Other associations are less consistent, e.g. urban residence is associated with higher levels of fear in some countries and lower levels in others. The paper considers the potential effects of crime fear on mobility beyond the home, health status and quality of life. A strong association is found for mobility, but effects on health and quality of life are harder to interpret as the direction of causality can be two-way. Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential impact of crime fear on older people's wellbeing and highlights a need for further, more contextualised research. © Copyright 2015 Cambridge University Press.",crime; fear; health; low- and middle-income countries,"Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Psychology, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India",English

"Saha P., Bose I., Mahanti A.",A knowledge based scheme for risk assessment in loan processing by banks,2016,Decision Support Systems,"Inadequacy in the compliance auditing (CA) process is one of the major reasons behind corporate frauds and accrual of non-performing assets within the banking sector. This phenomenon threatens the organization, stakeholders and society at large. The traditional CA process is slow and often inadequate in highly regulated and networked sectors such as banking, insurance and healthcare. This paper proposes a knowledge driven automated compliance auditing scheme for the processing of loans by banks. We collect 100 cases that are designated as fraudulent by banks and use them to design an automated risk score card model. The model uses text mining to automatically classify DPCs (Deviation Pattern Components) from unstructured text based cases. DPC patterns in a case give an early indication of the portfolio turning into a NPA. At the same time the cases are reviewed by five expert auditors in order to determine their risk level, risk impact and ease of detection. A logistic regression based model is used to derive risk scores of the case studies and classify the cases. By incorporating experts' opinion along with data mining techniques, the model automates the prediction of risk level, risk impact and ease of detection of fraudulent cases that deal with loan processing. The classifier performs well in terms of various performance metrics. The knowledge based method has the potential to save time and expensive human resources by automating the risk analysis of fraudulent loan processing cases reported by banks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Winkler J., Moser R.",Biases in future-oriented Delphi studies: A cognitive perspective,2016,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Delphi is an established information gathering and forecasting approach that has proven to deliver valuable results in a wide variety of specialist fields. Yet, Delphi studies have also continuously been subject to critique and doubt, particularly concerning its judgmental and forecasting accuracy. To a large part this can be attributed to the substantial discretion researchers have in their design and implementation. Awkwardly designed Delphi studies may lead to severe cognitive biases that adversely affect the research results. This paper takes a cognitive perspective by investigating how different cognitive biases take effect within future-oriented Delphi studies and how their unfavorable impacts can be mitigated by thoroughly adapting specific Delphi design features. The analysis addresses cognitive biases affecting panelists' initial estimates - namely framing and anchoring as well as the desirability bias - as well as such cognitive biases taking effect during feedback and revision loops - namely the bandwagon effect and belief perseverance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Anchoring; Bandwagon effect; Belief perseverance; Cognitive biases; Desirability bias; Framing,"Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, A-10, Sector 62, Noida, 201307, India; Indian Institute of Management Lucknow, Noida Campus, B-1, Sector 62, Noida, 201307, India",English
"Bajaj B., Pande N.",Mediating role of resilience in the impact of mindfulness on life satisfaction and affect as indices of subjective well-being,2016,Personality and Individual Differences,"Recent research has established the effect of mindfulness on subjective well-being. In this present study we attempt to extend the previous literature by investigating the potential mediating role of resilience in the impact of mindfulness on life satisfaction and affect as indices of subjective well-being. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) were administered to 327 undergraduate university students in India. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that resilience partially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and life satisfaction and affect components. The findings corroborate an important role of resilience in mindfulness exerting its beneficial effects. This study makes a contribution to the potential mechanism of the association between mindfulness and subjective well-being. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Affect; Life satisfaction; Mindfulness; Resilience; Subjective well-being,"Department of Chemistry, P.N.S.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper is a literature review focusing on: the current state of research on school-based yoga interventions; a preliminary theoretical model outlining the potential mechanisms and effects of school-based yoga; similarities, differences and possibilities for integrating school-based SEL, yoga and meditation; practical implications for researching and implementing yoga in schools. Findings - Research suggests that providing yoga within the school curriculum may be an effective way to help students develop self-regulation, mind-body awareness and physical fitness, which may, in turn, foster additional SEL competencies and positive student outcomes such as improved behaviours, mental state, health and performance. Research limitations/implications - Given that research on school-based yoga is in its infancy, most existing studies are preliminary and are of low to moderate methodological quality. It will be important for future research to employ more rigorous study designs. Practical implications - It is possible, pending additional high-quality research, that yoga could become a well-accepted component of school curricula. It will be particularly important for future research to examine possibilities around integrating school-based yoga and meditation with SEL programs at the individual, group and school-wide levels.

The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. The models were validated using split sample method. For facilitating clinical usefulness, score charts were derived from the regression models.Results: The variables motor score, hypotension, pupillary reactivity, age, creatinine level, limb movement (hemiparesis), and tSAH/IVH were found to be the most predictive independent prognostic factors of both mortality and functioning outcome. For both the outcomes, discriminative ability of the three prognostic models was excellent in the development dataset (AUC = 0.845-0.905) as well as the validation data set (AUC = 0.836-0.880). Calibration in the validation data set for model-2 was good (H-L test p-value > 0.05); however, for model-1 and model-3, it was poor (H-L test p-value < 0.05).Conclusion: For clinical decision-making, model-2 is recommended on the basis of good performance in predicting outcomes in patients with moderate or severe TBI in India and other similar countries. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",atraumatic brain injury; Glasgow outcome scale; head injury; outcome; prognostic models,"Institut für Psychologie, Technische Universität Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany; Department of Philosophy, Pondicherry University, Puducherry, India",English
"Sedlmeier P., Srinivas K.",How do theories of cognition and consciousness in ancient indian thought systems relate to current western theorizing and research?,2016,Frontiers in Psychology,"Unknown to most Western psychologists, ancient Indian scriptures contain very rich, empirically derived psychological theories that are, however, intertwined with religious and philosophical content. This article represents our attempt to extract the psychological theory of cognition and consciousness from a prominent ancient Indian thought system: Samkhya-Yoga. We derive rather broad hypotheses from this approach that may complement and extend Western mainstream theorizing. These hypotheses address an ancient personality theory, the effects of practicing the applied part of Samkhya-Yoga on normal and extraordinary cognition, as well as different ways of perceiving reality. We summarize empirical evidence collected (mostly without reference to the Indian thought system) in diverse fields of research that allows for making judgments about the hypotheses, and suggest more specific hypotheses to be examined in future research. We conclude that the existing evidence for the (broad) hypotheses is substantial but that there are still considerable gaps in theory and research to be filled. Theories of cognition contained in the ancient Indian systems have the potential to modify and complement existing Western mainstream accounts of cognition. In particular, they might serve as a basis for arriving at more comprehensive theories for several research areas that, so far, lack strong theoretical grounding, such as meditation research or research on aspects of consciousness. © 2016 Sedlmeier and Srinivas.",Cognition; Consciousness; Extraordinary cognition; Meditation research; Samkhya-Yoga,"IndoUS Center on Biological Timing, Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi, 110007, India; Department of Zoology, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, 226 007, India; Department of Zoology, Mizoram University, Aizawl, 796 004, India",English

This study investigated the role of the pineal gland in development of the nighttime migratory restlessness (Zugunruhe) and generation of circadian gene oscillations in the retina, brain and liver tissues in migratory redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps). Pinealectomized (pinx) and sham-operated buntings entrained to short days (8h light: 16h darkness, 8L:16D) were sequentially exposed for 10days each to stimulatory long days (13L: 11D) and constant dim light (LLdim; a condition that tested circadian rhythm persistence). Whereas activity-rest pattern was monitored continuously, the mRNA expressions of clock genes (bmal1, clock, npas2, per2, cry1, rorα, reverα) were measured in the retina, hypothalamus, telencephalon, optic tectum and liver tissues at circadian times, CT, 1, 6, 13, 17 and 21 (CT 0, activity onset) on day 11 of the LLdim. The absence of the pineal gland did not affect the development of long-day induced Zugunruhe but caused decay of the circadian rhythm in Zugunruhe as well as the clock gene oscillations in the hypothalamus, but not in the retina. Further, there were variable effects of pinealectomy in the peripheral brain and liver tissue circadian gene oscillations, notably the persistence of per 2 and cry1 (optic tectum), rorα (telencephalon) and npas2 (liver) mRNA oscillations in pinx birds. We suggest the pineal gland dependence of the generation of circadian gene oscillations in the hypothalamus, not retina, and peripheral brain and liver tissues in migratory redheaded buntings. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Bunting; Circadian; Clock gene; Hypothalamus; Peripheral oscillator; Pineal; Retina,"Psychophysiology Laboratory, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India",English

This study attempted to determine whether this impaired disengagement of attention is lateralized in the brain. Thirty depressed and 30 control participants performed an attention disengagement task wherein the valence of the stimulus and the visual field was presented. The depressed group had longer reaction times than the control group, indicative of the typical cognitive and psychomotor slowing seen in depression. The effect of visual field presentation on the ability to disengage attention however was different for controls as compared to the patients. In controls, a distinct right hemisphere advantage was seen for disengaging attention which is in line with research that has identified right hemisphere structures as the seat of behavioural inhibition. In the depressed group, however, this right hemisphere advantage was not observed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Cognitive bias; inhibition; valence; visual field,"Centre for Health Psychology, University of Hyderabad, Central University Campus PO, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, 500046, India",English

In addition to a headache, seizures, and focal deficits, this is associated with significant cognitive dysfunction. Many studies revealed that the number and location of lesions are not always responsible for cognitive dysfunction. Cholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase are found in the walls of the cysticercus which could contribute to cholinergic depletion and thus cognitive dysfunction. Patients and Methods: A total of 43 patients who presented with NCC were evaluated for cognitive deficits, as well as cholinesterase levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with control CSF from patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Blood levels of interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were also estimated and correlated with cognitive deficits. Results: There is a mild increase in the acetylcholinesterase in CSF of patients compared to controls, but it did not correlate with cognitive deficits. There is an increase in interleukins to a significant level which correlates with vesicular stage of the organism and cognitive impairment. The number of lesions also correlated with cognitive impairment even though the location did not. The domains of cognitive deficits seen are sustained attention, category fluency, verbal working memory, planning, set shifting, verbal learning, visual memory, and construction. Discussion and Conclusion: NCC is associated with multi-domain cognitive impairment correlates with vescicular stage, proinflammatory cytokines and number of lesions but not location, vesicular stage, and proinflammatory cytokines. © 2016 Indian Psychiatric Society | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Cholinesterase levels; cognitive dysfunction; neurocysticercosis,"Bethune College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India; University of Calcutta, Kolkata, West Bengal, India",English
"Banerjee P., Basu J.",Therapeutic Relationship as a Change Agent in Psychotherapy: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis,2016,Journal of Humanistic Psychology,"The study qualitatively explored the clients’ and their psychotherapists’ perspectives on the mutative role of therapeutic relationship. The sample was composed of 13 psychotherapist participants from four professional backgrounds, namely, psychoanalysts, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists trained in psychotherapy, and trained psychotherapists not belonging to the above three categories, as well as 16 clients who have successfully completed individual psychotherapy with any one of these 13 psychotherapists in a city in India. Semistructured interviews conducted separately with the client–psychotherapist dyads were analyzed qualitatively using interpretative phenomenological analysis. The themes that emerged suggested five major antecedent processes within the therapeutic relationship namely, listening, containing, reflection of past relationship, obedience–surrender, and curative relational experience. These were related to one or more consequential change processes such as emotional unburdening, acceptance and validation of emotions, generation of emotional strength, setting stage for therapeutic interventions, and reformulation of self or relationships. The clients and their therapists agreed on some functions, but not on all details. Culturally informed interpretations have been proposed in the context of obedience–surrender as a therapeutic process.

Our goal here is to identify the neural correlates of visually driven 'edible-inedible' perceptual distinction. We also investigate correlates of the finer-grained likability assessment. Our stimuli depicted food or non-food items with sub-classes of appealing or unappealing exemplars. Using data-classification techniques drawn from machine-learning, as well as evoked-response analyses, we sought to determine whether these four classes of stimuli could be distinguished based on the patterns of brain activity they elicited. Subjects viewed 200 images while in a MEG scanner. Our analyses yielded two successes and a surprising failure. The food/non-food distinction had a robust neural counterpart and emerged as early as 85 ms post-stimulus onset. The likable/non-likable distinction too was evident in the neural signals when food and non-food stimuli were grouped together, or when only the non-food stimuli were included in the analyses. However, we were unable to identify any neural correlates of this distinction when limiting the analyses only to food stimuli. Taken together, these positive and negative results further our understanding of the substrates of a set of ecologically important judgments and have clinical implications for conditions like eating-disorders and anhedonia. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Edibility; Image representation; Likability; Machine learning; MEG; Visual distinction,"Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1165 Morris Park Avenue, Bronx, New York  10461, United States; Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States; Department of Imaging Science and Interventional Radiology, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India; Department of Neurology, Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode, Kerala, India",English

Objective:We examined the relationship between cerebral small vessel disease and motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), a recently described pre-dementia syndrome, in Indian seniors. Methods: 139 participants (mean age 66.6±5.4 y, 33.1% female) participating in the Kerala-Einstein study in Southern India were examined in a cross-sectional study. The presence of cerebral small vessel disease (lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds (CMB)) and white matter hyperintensities on MRI was ascertained by raters blinded to clinical information. MCR was defined by the presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait in older adults without dementia or mobility disability. Results: Thirty-eight (27.3%) participants met MCR criteria. The overall prevalence of lacunar infarcts and CMB was 49.6% and 9.4%, respectively. Lacunar infarcts in the frontal lobe, but no other brain regions, were associated with MCR even after adjusting for vascular risk factors and presence of white matter hyperintensities (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 4.67, 95% CI: 1.69-12.94). Frontal lacunar infarcts were associated with slow gait (aOR: 3.98, 95% CI: 1.46-10.79) and poor performance on memory test (α: -1.24, 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.05), but not with cognitive complaints or non-memory tests. No association of CMB was found with MCR, individual MCR criterion or cognitive tests. Conclusions: Frontal lacunar infarcts are associated with MCR in Indian seniors, perhaps, by contributing to slow gait and poor memory function. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

It has been poorly studied in low-middle income countries such as India both within acute care as well as long stay settings.272 psychiatry admissions had 19.9% prevalence of agitation with the most common form being non goal directed physical agitation (13.6%). Episodes of agitation were most likely to occur on the 3rd or 2nd day of admission. Substance abuse [O.R. = 2.51(1.05-5.99)] and the presence of persecutory delusions [O.R. = 2.62(1.34-5.15)] were independently associated with agitation. It is difficult to predict violence in acutely ill individuals and there is evidence that the emergence of more serious aggression may be preceded by milder forms of agitation. Therefore, there is a need to identify various forms of agitation and its correlates.

Current pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy, with associated side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may represent an alternative treatment, as cognitive improvements have been demonstrated in healthy individuals. However, no studies to date have assessed the feasibility of tDCS in an LBD population. The aim of this preliminary study, therefore, was to assess the tolerability of tDCS, as well as its effects upon attentional and visuoperceptual performance, in LBD patients. Methods: Thirteen participants completed attentional (simple reaction time, choice reaction time, and digit vigilance) and forced-choice visuoperceptual (angle and motion perception) tasks before and after one 20-min session of active tDCS (0.08 mA/cm2). The anodal electrode was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathodal electrode was applied to the right deltoid. Attentional (task accuracy and reaction time to correct answers) and visuoperceptual (task accuracy and difficulty) outcome measures were compared using paired t-tests. Results: All participants tolerated stimulation and did not report any side effects during or immediately after stimulation. Post-stimulation improvements were observed in the choice reaction time (increased percentage of correct answers; p = 0.01) and digit vigilance (reduced mean reaction time to correct answers; p = 0.02) attention tasks. Visuoperceptual task performance did not improve (all p-values &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Attentional, but not visuoperceptual, improvements were observed following stimulation in LBD patients.

Design/methodology/approach – A survey-based study was performed among 349 nursing staff working in Uttarakhand, randomly selected from six public healthcare institutes, using a well-established questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was applied to study the mediating effect of affective commitment and its correlation with the constructs used in research. Findings – The findings of the study revealed that the level of burnout is significantly higher among the nursing staff and had an inverse relation with affective commitment. Further, perceived organizational support and procedural justice showed a positive relation with affective commitment in contrast to burnout. Moreover, affective commitment had a strong impact on job performance of the nursing staff, indicated by direct relation with a value of 0.70. Research limitations/implications – The findings contribute by recognizing the various factors affecting the performance of nursing staff specifically in developing country like India. Limited in geographical area, industry and a self-rated questionnaire are some of the limitations of the present study. Practical implications – To conclude, this study revealed the vital significance of factors affecting the job performance of nursing staff through affective commitment. Based on the findings, healthcare institutions need to reduce the level of burnout, create and enhance a supportive and fair working environment to enhance the level of affective commitment and consequently the job performance of the nursing staff.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with words, objects, and faces as stimuli in an n-back WM task to delineate the similarities and differences in brain activation during presentation of verbal and visual stimuli. The results revealed a predominantly left lateralized core fronto-parieto-cerebellar identity WM network comprising bilateral insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, and cerebellum that is common to all stimuli. In addition, our results showed stimulus-specific recruitment of brain regions, with exclusive activations in left inferior frontal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus for identity WM for verbal stimuli, and left middle occipital gyrus and cerebellum for identity WM for visual stimuli.

These features suggest a considerable but largely overlooked potential for similarities and differences in the structure, endorsement, and wellness-promoting functions of justice beliefs across cultures. In the current research, we evaluate a recently available four-factor conceptualization of justice beliefs in samples of university students from the United States, Canada, India, and China (total N = 922). Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the proposed four-factor model was structurally invariant, suggesting that individuals from all four cultures could be characterized according to their beliefs about distributive and procedural justice for both self and others. Cross-cultural comparisons revealed no mean differences in beliefs about distributive justice for self, whereas beliefs about procedural justice for self were higher in Canada and China than in the United States or India. In parallel, beliefs about distributive and procedural justice for others were higher in Eastern than in Western cultures. In all four cultures, a belief in distributive justice for self was associated with greater life satisfaction, whereas a belief in procedural justice for self was additionally associated in Canada and China only. No associations between beliefs about justice for others and life satisfaction were observed in any culture. The current research provides initial support for the cross-cultural viability of a four-factor approach to measuring dispositional tendencies to believe in justice.

Male Swiss albino mice were treated with edaravone (3 & 10. mg/kg. i.p.) once daily for 14. days. On the 14th day 30. min after edaravone treatment mice were challenged with LPS (1. mg/kg. i.p.). After 3. h and 24. h of LPS administration we've tested mice for anxiety and depressive-like behaviors respectively. Western blotting analysis of PARP-1 in hippocampus was carried out after 12. h of LPS administration. Moreover, after 24. h of LPS administration serum corticosterone, hippocampal BDNF, oxido-nitrosative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines were estimated by ELISA. Results showed that pretreatment of edaravone (10. mg/kg) ameliorates LPS-induced anxiety and depressive-like behavior. Western blotting analysis showed that LPS-induced anomalous expression of PARP-1 significantly reverses by the pretreatment of edaravone (10. mg/kg).Biochemical analyses revealed that LPS significantly diminishes BDNF, increases pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxido-nitrosative stress in the hippocampus. However, pretreatment with edaravone (10. mg/kg) prominently reversed all these biochemical alterations. Our study emphasized that edaravone pretreatment prevents LPS-induced anxiety and depressive-like behavior, mainly by impeding the inflammation, oxido-nitrosative stress and PARP-1 overexpression. © 2015.",Anxiety; Depressive-like behavior; Edaravone; Lipopolysaccharide; Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1,"Division of Yoga and Humanities, S-VYASA Yoga University, Bengaluru, India; Chancellor, S-VYASA Yoga University, Bengaluru, India",English

Yoga has a profound knowledge base and practical solutions for such traumatic consequences. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of a Yoga program on the physical fitness of adolescents staying in an orphanage. A total of 72 apparently healthy adolescents participated from an orphanage. They were randomized (based on their age and gender) and allocated into two groups as Yoga group (n = 40; 14 girls, 26 boys and age = 12.69 ± 1.35) and Wait-List Control group (WLC) (n = 32, 13 girls, 19 boys and age = 12.58 ± 1.52). The Yoga group (YG) underwent 3 months of Yoga program in a schedule of 90 mins/day and 4 days/week, whereas the WLC group underwent day-to-day activities. European physical fitness test battery (EUROFIT) was assessed in both groups at the beginning and end of the program. The group × time interaction analysis showed significant (p < 0.05) positive differences in Flamingo left-leg balance (FLL), Flamingo right-leg balance (FLR), left-hand tapping test (PTL), right-hand tapping test (PTR), sit and reach (SAR), standing broad jump (SBJ), sit-ups (SUP), bent arm hang (BAH) test, shuttle run (SHR) in YG compared to WLC group. Further analysis done on group × time interaction along with Bonferroni-corrected p-values showed significant positive differences in FLL, FLR, PTL, PTR, SAR, SBJ and SUP in YG compared to WLC group. The results suggested that the 3-month Yoga program was found useful for the young orphan adolescents in improving their physical fitness. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",adolescents; EUROFIT; orphans; physical fitness; Yoga,"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English
Pandya S.P.,"Promoting spiritual well-being among Hindu children in South Asian, Southeast Asian and African Countries: Bala Vihars of Chinmaya Mission",2016,International Journal of Children's Spirituality,"The main objective of the study is to examine whether the Bala Vihars (BVs) of Chinmaya Mission promote spiritual well-being among Hindu children in different cultural contexts. Deploying a comparative survey design, 1194 BV participants aged 11-15 years, across 13 South Asian, African and Southeast Asian cities comprised the sample and an equal number comprised the comparison group. Email questionnaire was used comprising scales to assess spiritual well-being, operationalised through attitudes to Hinduism, hope, happiness, strengths and self-concept. Results of scale scores, ANOVA and logistic regression showed that BV participants scored better on all parameters and their scores, in turn, were contingent on attendance regularity, self-practice, and the consolidated learning of Hindu culture tenets, life skills and moral values. The BV programme significantly promotes child spiritual well-being, corroborating the extant literature on religiosity, spirituality and children's spiritual well-being. The programme works best for children who attend regularly, undertake self-practice and claim to get a consolidated package of tenets of Hindu culture, life skills and moral values. This has implications for practitioners in designing consolidated forms of religious programmes for children's spiritual well-being, giving a simultaneous emphasis on regularity of engagement and self-practice. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bala Vihars; Children; happiness; Hindu; hope; religion; religiosity; self-concept; spiritual wellbeing; spirituality,"Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States; Baldwin Wallace University, Berea, OH, United States; The Humsafar Trust, Mumbai, India; Health Science Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX, United States",English

Guoqiong H.,Effects of self-regulated learning and cooperative learning on academic achievements of Chinese EFL learners: Reference to international standard english tests,2016,International Journal of Pedagogy and Curriculum,"Since the 1980s, self-regulated learning (i.e. SRL) has become one of the hottest topics in educational psychology, the supporters of which believe students should be responsible for their own academic achievement. As well, cooperative learning (i.e. CL) ability plays an important role in foreign language studying process. Believers of CL claim that learning is a process to satisfy an individual's inner needs. This study was conducted to examine the effects of SRL and CL on academic achievements (four skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing) of Chinese English as a Foreign Language learners (i.e. Chinese EFL learners). Academic achievement was assessed with grades from standardized test scores including TOEFL, IELTS, and BEC. Participants were Chinese EFL learners from different provinces of China as well as those studying in other countries. They were asked to fill the questionnaire that consisted of three parts: SRL learning assessment, CL learning assessment, and some background questions. In this study, 386 valid samples were obtained in total. SPSS 21.0 was adopted for the purpose of compiling and analyzing the statistics. The main findings were found as follow: The implication of hypothesis 1 declaimed that the SRL strategies might help Chinese EFL learners to improve their four skills in studying English. The implication of hypothesis 2 indicated that the CL methods might help Chinese EFL learners to improve their listening and speaking skills. The implication of hypothesis 3 indicated that there was a significant and positive relationship between SRL and CL. The results of regression analyses revealed that CL methods had a significant effect on self-monitoring and organizing and reviewing. © Common Ground, Huang Guoqiong.",Academic achievements; Chinese EFL learners; Cooperative learning; Self-regulated learning,"Department of Applied Psychology, Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Amarkantak, 484 886, India; Department of Psychology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221 005, India",English

Such decrement in performance gets intensified during higher event rate condition. The present study was conducted on 40 male undergraduate and postgraduate students to examine the effects of event rate and task duration on behavioural, physiological and subjective measures. Two event rates were manipulated and mental workload was measured prior to and after the 40-minutes successive discrimination vigilance task. Correct responses were higher under low event rate while both event rates showed decrement in accuracy with progress in time block. Heart rate and heart rate variability pattern observed across time period in two event rate conditions were inconsistent with previous researches. Perceived mental workload increased from pre to post task session though the workload was reported as similar under high and low event rate conditions. Maintaining vigilance is a demanding task which resulted in deterioration of performance as well as mounting of perceived mental workload.

By using an interrupted time-series design with one group, 100 patients were observed. They responded to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale before surgery, at the first review (a week after hospital discharge), and at the second review (a month after first review). Participants also completed the Adherence Scale for Cardiac Patients, and the Biopsychosocial Prognosis Scale for CABG at the second review. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses revealed that anxiety and depression at three time-points before and after surgery together predicted participants' outcomes by significantly explaining up to 21% of variance in adherence and 52% of variance in prognosis. However, simple linear regression analysis showed that adherence significantly explained only 5% of variance in prognosis. Psychological distress, thus, affects how effectively patients follow the post-operative care regimen and how well they recover after CABG. © 2016 by the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Adherence; CABG; Interrupted time-series design with one group; Prognosis; Psychological distress,"University Dept. of Psychology, T.M.

As indicators of psychological wellbeing five positive traits viz., self-concept, self-efficacy, ego-strength, emotional stability and life satisfaction and five negative traits viz., anxiety, insecurity alienation, identity crisis and loneliness were selected. The yogic practices undertaken were Kapalbhati, Anulom-Vilom, Bhramri, Tratak, Dhyan and Yognidra. Around 500 subjects who were retired officials (in the age group of 65-75 years) were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups in equal numbers. The experimental groups practiced yogic techniques for half an hour daily for six months, which was the intervention period- while the control group continued with their normal activities. The two groups were tested and retested after the intervention period on the measures of psychological wellbeing. The comparisons revealed that there was a significant improvement in the psychological wellbeing of the experimental (yoga) group- but, no difference was found in the control group. Hence, it can be concluded that yogic practices could lead to a holistic and balanced life among the aged. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Ageing; Psychological well-being; Yogic practices,"Department of Management Studies, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Durgapur, India",English

Psychological Capital or PsyCap, a derivative of POB, is a core construct comprising Hope, Optimism, Efficacy and Resiliency. In light of this zeitgeist, the present study was an attempt to explore the nature of PsyCap and its impact on Happiness among the Indian employees. Furthermore, the effect of gender and employees' job category as well as their interaction effect on PsyCap was also investigated in the research study. Stratified Random Sampling of 100 employees belonging to a pharmaceutical company located at Kanpur, U.P. was used to collect data. Data were collected from both the male and female employees (including executives as well as non-executives), by administering the adapted versions of the PsyCap Questionnaire and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. After checking on the normality of the data, analysis was done by computing percentages, and applying Factorial (2x2) Anova and Simple Linear Regression. Results of the present study indicated the existence of a high level of PsyCap among the employees. It further revealed that the effect of gender and job category on PsyCap was insignificant and significant respectively, whereas the interaction effect of both these variables on PsyCap was statistically insignificant. Moreover, it was also found that PsyCap predicted significantly the Happiness of the employees with respect to the present sample. © 2016 by the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Efficacy; Employee Happiness; Hope; Optimism; Psychological Capital; Resiliency,"Department of Commerce and Business Administration, Khalsa College, Amritsar, India; University Business School, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India",English
"Vohra J., Soni P.",How do Indian mothers use feeding practices with children?,2016,Journal of Children's Services,"Purpose-The undesirable effects of TV advertisements and general parenting responsibility propel mothers to monitor and control the eating habits of children through meal time actions and feeding practices. The purpose of this paper is to identify feeding practices used by Indian mothers through the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire (CFPQ) developed by Musher-Eizenman and Holub (2007) and to investigate differences in the use of feeding practices across demographic variables. Design/methodology/approach-Using a cross-sectional design, a structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from 473 mothers of children aged four to 11 years from Punjab (India). Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and ANOVA. Findings-The present study confirms the validity and reliability of the nine-factor model through CFA with 28 items in the Indian context than original CFPQ. Further, significant differences exist in the responses of mothers for feeding practices followed with children across age and gender of child, mother's education status and monthly family income. Practical implications-Parents may understand the nature of feeding practices to mediate unhealthy food consumption habits of children. The government should formulate codes or regulations to sufficiently monitor food marketing activities directed at children. The food marketing companies should also act responsibly to protect well-being of children.

"Das S., Upadhaya P., Giri S.","Arsenic and smokeless tobacco induce genotoxicity, sperm abnormality as well as oxidative stress in mice in vivo",2016,Genes and Environment,"Background: Arsenic, a naturally occurring metalloid is a well-known water contaminant which causes a wide range of serious adverse health effects including cancer upon long-term exposure. Recent studies have shown high arsenic contamination in the ground water of North Eastern states of India including Southern Assam. Smokeless tobacco consumption locally known as ""sadagura"" is one of the most prevalent life style habit in southern Assam. The present study was undertaken in mice test system in vivo. Mice were exposed to smokeless tobacco (5 mg/kg body weight/day) and sodium arsenite (0.2 mg/kg body weight/day, 2 mg/kg body weight/day) independently and in combination for 90 days. Results: The results were compared with groups with only sodium arsenite exposure and groups which were exposed to only smokeless tobacco extract. Genotoxicity was evaluated by studying the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes from bone marrow. Both the tested doses of sodium arsenite induced statistically significant micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes as compared to control group, however, sodium arsenite and smokeless tobacco extract could not increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes as compared to their individual counterparts when treated in combination in mice test system. Germ cell toxicity was evaluated by recording the sperm head abnormalities and total sperm count. Combined treatment of sodium arsenite and smokeless tobacco extract in lower dose induced a significant increase in sperm head abnormality as compared to only sodium arsenite and smokeless tobacco extract. Liver, kidney and intestine tissues were analyzed for various oxidative stress evaluations such as lipid peroxidation (MDA), Glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay. Sodium arsenite in combination with smokeless tobacco extract show higher genotoxic and germ cell toxic effects as compared to control but not when compared to their individual counterparts. Conclusion: Impairment of the sperm head morphology by sodium arsenite and smokeless tobacco extract alone and in combination with lower dose of sodium arsenite could be oxidative stress mediated effects. Besides, combination treatment of both the agents may not produce additive effects related to micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes induction and decline of total sperm count. © 2016 Das et al.",Lipid peroxidation; Micronucleus assay; Reduced glutathione; Smokeless tobacco; Sodium arsenite; Sperm head abnormality; Superoxide dismutase,"Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milano, Milan, Italy; Department of Psychology, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia; Africa Unit for Transdisciplinary Health Research, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa; School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil; Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad De Palermo, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Department of Applied Psychology, School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal; Estudios Sobre Equidad y Genero and FES-Iztacala, Proyecto Aprendizaje Humano, Unidad de Investigacion Interdisciplinaria en Ciencias de la Salud y la Educacion, Centro Regional de Investigaciones Multidisciplinarias, Uni.

However, little is known about lay people's understanding of happiness. Building on the available literature, this study explored lay definitions of happiness across nations and cultural dimensions, analyzing their components and relationship with participants' demographic features. Participants were 2799 adults (age range = 30-60, 50% women) living in urban areas of Argentina, Brazil, Croatia, Hungary, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, and United States. They completed the Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation (EHHI), reporting, among other information, their own definition of happiness. Answers comprised definitions referring to a broad range of life domains, covering both the contextual-social sphere and the psychological sphere. Across countries and with little variation by age and gender, inner harmony predominated among psychological definitions, and family and social relationships among contextual definitions. Whereas relationships are widely acknowledged as basic happiness components, inner harmony is substantially neglected. Nevertheless, its cross-national primacy, together with relations, is consistent with the view of an ontological interconnectedness characterizing living systems, shared by several conceptual frameworks across disciplines and cultures. At the methodological level, these findings suggest the potential of a bottom-up, mixed method approach to contextualize psychological dimensions within culture and lay understanding. © 2016 Delle Fave, Brdar, Wissing, Araujo, Castro Solano, Freire, Hernández-Pozo, Jose, Martos, Nafstad, Nakamura, Singh and Soosai-Nathan.",Adulthood; Culture; Happiness; Inner harmony; Interconnectedness; Lay definitions; Relationships,"Department of Clinical Neurosciences, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, 560 029, India; Department of Neurology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Neurophysiology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",English

At one level, this study traces the sacredness imbued in colours and at another level the article delves into the genealogy that gives rise to a complex where colour, colonial investment in the economy of colours (with an aim at capitalizing colours as commodities), values and experiential dynamics enshrined in the imageries and practices associated with colours all come together. With these entanglements, the idea is to engage with the social fabrics and the politics of colours in the Indian milieu. In this rendering, the distinction between values and forms collapses giving us in turn a field of aesthetic experience. Mobilizing a wide range of registers (written as well as pictorial, archival as well as literary), this story is narrated with key rubrics, such as, ambiguous location of colour in the discourse on visuality, social and cultural life of colours and the manner in which Western science and modernity has influenced the values pertaining to colours. However, the core anxiety is parked on the relation between colour, aesthetic experience and the question of value. © 2016 Management Centre for Human Values SAGE Publications.",colonial economy; colour as surface; colours; social history; Values,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India",English
Chakrabarti A.,Democracy as Civil Religion: Reading Alexis de Tocqueville in India,2016,Journal of Human Values,"The article explores Alexis de Tocqueville's explication of democracy as 'civil religion' or the new sacred of modern times. In Democracy in America, Tocqueville analyzed democracy as a political system as well as a moral value. The article begins with Tocqueville's analysis of the religious roots of American democracy. Dissociated from the affairs of the state through the principle of 'disestablishment', religion became secure in civil society, whereas the concept of democracy became inviolable and 'set apart' as sacred. He noted that the power of the majority acquires an inviolable character in democracy that had the potential to turn against the very principles that it upholds. In the Indian context, the debate around a uniform civil code (UCC) is one such issue that captures this predicament. Working out a roadmap for Indian pluralism signposted with a constitutional commitment to equality, liberty and fraternity has proved to be a task fraught with moral and political complexities, if not impasse. The article argues that Tocqueville's discovery of the role of religion in civil society, his mistrust of democratic majoritarianism and his emphasis on understanding the 'practice' of democracy have something to offer to the polarized UCC debate in India. © 2016 Management Centre for Human Values SAGE Publications.",adjudication; Democracy; pluralism; uniform civil code,"School of Studies in Chemistry, Pt.

Mitra S.,"Synergies Among Monetary, Multidimensional and Subjective Poverty: Evidence from Nepal",2016,Social Indicators Research,"In this paper we construct a Nepal specific multidimensional poverty index using the Nepal Longitudinal Sample Survey (NLSS) for the period 1995–2010. The indicators for Nepal Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMP) have been chosen using the goals set by the Government of Nepal and the perceptions of adequacy as reported by households. In doing so this study combines multidimensional and subjective methods of measuring wellbeing. The subjective data is used to guide the choice of dimensions for the multidimensional analysis. Our findings show that Nepal has had a dramatic fall in multidimensional poverty along with the observed fall in consumption poverty in this period. Comparing the extent to which consumption poverty accurately identifies the multidimensionally poor, we find the error has reduced over time but remains large in proportion to the poverty rate implying the need for a multidimensional measure. For the different ethnic groups and regions the patterns of reduction in poverty are not homogenous and are different from those of consumption poverty with the NMP outperforming the consumption poverty in tracking targeted policy actions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Multidimensional poverty; Shapley value decomposition; Subjective well-being,"Bangabasi Morning College, 19, Rajkumar Chakraborty Sarani, Kolkata, West Bengal  700009, India; Department of Economics, Burdwan University, Golapbag, Burdwan, West Bengal  713104, India",English
"Sinha Babu S., Datta S.K.",A Study of Co-variation and Convergence of Alternative Measures of Sustainability on the Basis of Panel Data,2016,Social Indicators Research,"The study highlights the need for creating alternative indicators of sustainability for considering a well guarded view about sustainable development of a country. The aim of the study is (1) to focus on different alternative measures of sustainability, (2) to assess whether these alternative measures move in the same direction which indicates peoples’ wellbeing as well as maintenance of environmental health and (3) to ascertain whether there has been some tendency towards convergence among the considered countries based on the alternative sustainability measures. Four alternative sustainability indicators like Green Net National Product, Ecological Footprint, Sustainable Human Development Index and Pollution Sensitive Human Development Index, for 22 developing countries have been constructed. Correlation matrix has been considered to focus on the extent of consistency between alternative indices. Unit root test has been done to ensure the stationarity of time series of such indices. The issue of convergence of different sustainability indices has been analysed by use of beta and sigma convergence employing pooled OLS and fixed effect model. It has been found that the different indices are more or less mutually consistent and stationary and over time they have converged across the considered countries. The results indicate that despite convergence coherent with Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, the level of environmental degradation when linked to GDP per capita gives rise to an N-shaped pattern.

"Dhiman G., Chakraborty J.N.","Antimicrobial performance of cotton finished with triclosan, silver and chitosan",2015,Fashion and Textiles,"Antimicrobial agents are applied on textiles to suppress growth of microorganism, odour generation as well as its deterioration. Cotton fabric was finished with three different types of antimicrobial agents (1) Ultrafresh NMV2: a triclosan based product, (2) N9 Pure silver: a dispersion of pure silver metal, and (3) chitosan to develop antimicrobial characteristics. Finished fabrics were evaluated for their effectiveness against Gram positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacterium (Escherichia coli) in terms of percentage reduction in CFU of bacteria. The influence of finishing methods, via. pad-dry and pad-dry-cure followed by repeated launderings, concentrations of antibacterial agents, and pH were optimised. The antimicrobial performance was evaluated prior to laundering and after each five laundering cycles; results were statistically analysed and effects on physical properties of the finished fabric were also evaluated. Triclosan was found to be significantly effective at low concentrations, whereas silver showed remarkably good antimicrobial activity at or above 10 g/L and chitosan was comparably less active compared to others. Cyclic laundering showed statistically significant effect on activity of finishes up to five cycles but it was almost reduced to half for chitosan. © 2015, Dhiman and Chakraborty.",Antimicrobial; Chitosan; E. coli; S. aureus; Silver; Triclosan,"Department of Textile Technology, National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, 144011, India",English

However, longevity of aroma on the textile with the time passage and subsequent launderings is a major concern for researchers and consumers too. In this work, essential oils of Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Lavender, Jasmine, Clove and Cedarwood were applied directly on cotton as well as with anchoring hosts as cyclodextrin in native and modified form viz. monochlorotriazine-β-cyclodextrin (MCT-βCD) to assess their stability of retention on the fabric surface. The release rate of oils, in isolation, had revealed the disappearance of fragrances rapidly with time as a result of weak physical forces between essential oils and textile surfaces in the absence of any anchoring hosts.

Out of 79 clinical psychology professionals contacted, 50 gave written informed consent for participation in study. The data obtained from Psycho-Therapeutic Identity Questionnaire (ThIdQ). Cluster analysis of the responses on attitude scales revealed broad themes of therapeutic identity in the form of three cluster profiles: Vague psychodynamic assumptions with high self-doubt and low optimism about change (n = 9); Entangled in their own strong feelings of limitations and doubts as a therapist (n = 16); and Eclectic approach with low self-doubt and high optimism about change(n = 25). A lack of synchrony was seen between assessed and reported therapeutic orientation with overuse of the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) orientation. Correlation findings indicated that increased work experience in the field and higher age were associated with low self-doubt and high optimism about change in therapy.

"Vaz M., Mahalingam R.",Implicit Theories of Common Health Conditions Held by Indian Social Workers and Students,2015,Psychological Studies,"Social work is viewed as a change-related profession. However, little is known about social workers’ own beliefs about change. To understand this, we used the implicit theory paradigm to compare theories about various health conditions held by social workers, social work students, and undergraduate students from Bombay, India (N = 352). The participants had to assess the possibility of change in four health conditions: cancer, tuberculosis, depression, and mental retardation. We predicted that social workers whose professional education involves concepts such as Person-in-Environment would display more incremental views of these conditions than students – namely that they are modifiable. Our predictions were supported for the following conditions: cancer, tuberculosis, and depression. These incremental views were neither related to age nor years of professional experience. Though we expected that the extent to which participants believed these health issues to be amenable to change would influence their support for a small personal tax, our findings did not bear this out. We explore the possible reasons for our findings and discuss their implications for health communication in India as well as for social work education. © 2015, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Essentialism; Health beliefs; Implicit theories; Lay theories; Social workers,"Department of Pharmacology, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, 110095, India; Department of Psychiatry, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, 110095, India; Department of Biochemistry, University College of Medical Sciences and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, New Delhi, 110095, India; Department of Pharmacology, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Smt.

For the purpose 200 elderly persons with mental illness (PMI), attending psychiatric services were included in the study. A comparison group of 103 well elderly persons was drawn from the same study area as control group (CG). They were assessed using WHO-DAS and WHOQOL-BREF. Results revealed that PMI experienced higher disability compared to the CG. Deficits in the domain of moving around, getting along with people, engaging in life activities and participation in society contributed most to the high level of disability in the PMI group. PMI from rural area had higher disability compared to the urban group. As for QOL, elderly PMI had a poor quality of life compared to the CG. Quality of life was found to be negatively associated with level of disability. Higher the level of disability, lower was the quality of life. The authors opine that persons with chronic mental illness continue to experience psychiatric disability in old age and this cannot be attributed to normal aging.

"Lu J., Xiong S., Arora N., Dubé L.",Using food as reinforcer to shape children's non-food behavior: The adverse nutritional effect doubly moderated by reward sensitivity and gender,2015,Eating Behaviors,"Purpose: Control rules are parental practices that use food, especially those high in fat or sugar, as an instrumental reinforcer to encourage children to behave in a normative manner in non-food domains. Past laboratory experiments show that repeatedly presenting snacks as a reward or associated with adults' attention, increases children's preference for the presented food. This field study aims to examine whether control rules are associated with children's increased everyday intake of food high in sugar/fat, and whether this effect is moderated by individual differences in neurobehavioral sensitivity to reward and in gender. Design: 207 six- to twelve-year-old children's parents reported the children's everyday dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire and provided information regarding the children's sensitivity to rewards as well as the frequency of enforcing control rules. Results: Children who lived in families with a high frequency of using control rules exhibited more daily fat, carbohydrate, and total energy intake than did children whose parents use control rules less often. Furthermore, the effect of control rules on dietary pattern was particularly strong for children with high reward sensitivity, especially boys. Conclusions: Control rules have adverse consequences on children's nutrition. The moderating effects of sensitivity to reward and gender are consistent to a reinforcement learning process-associating the high-fat/sugar food consumption with social-affective pleasure resulting from performing behavior desired by parents-through which parental control rules contribute to children's maladaptive dietary patterns. © 2015.",Dietary pattern; Food rules; Instrumental learning; Reinforcement; Sensitivity to reward,"Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, India; Department of Psychology, Harvard University, United States",English
"Chandrasekharan S., Nersessian N.J.",Building Cognition: The Construction of Computational Representations for Scientific Discovery,2015,Cognitive Science,"Novel computational representations, such as simulation models of complex systems and video games for scientific discovery (Foldit, EteRNA etc.), are dramatically changing the way discoveries emerge in science and engineering. The cognitive roles played by such computational representations in discovery are not well understood. We present a theoretical analysis of the cognitive roles such representations play, based on an ethnographic study of the building of computational models in a systems biology laboratory. Specifically, we focus on a case of model-building by an engineer that led to a remarkable discovery in basic bioscience. Accounting for such discoveries requires a distributed cognition (DC) analysis, as DC focuses on the roles played by external representations in cognitive processes. However, DC analyses by and large have not examined scientific discovery, and they mostly focus on memory offloading, particularly how the use of existing external representations changes the nature of cognitive tasks. In contrast, we study discovery processes and argue that discoveries emerge from the processes of building the computational representation. The building process integrates manipulations in imagination and in the representation, creating a coupled cognitive system of model and modeler, where the model is incorporated into the modeler's imagination. This account extends DC significantly, and we present some of the theoretical and application implications of this extended account. © 2015, Cognitive Science Society, Inc.",Digital media; Discovery; Distributed cognition; External representations; Scientific cognition; Systems biology,"Department of Management Sciences, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Lahore, Pakistan; Universiti Sultan ZainalAbidin, Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu  21300, Malaysia; ICFAI University, Tripura, Kamalghat, West Tripura, Sadar, Tripura  799210, India; Department of Economics, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor  43400, Malaysia",English

In doing so, we have applied the ARDL bounds testing approach to examine the long-run relationship in the presence of structural break in the series. The unit root properties have been tested by applying Zivot and Andrews (in J Bus Econ Stat 10:251–270, 1992) and Clemente et al. (in Econ Lett 59, 175–182, 1998) structural break tests. The VECM Granger causality approach is used to detect the direction of the causal relationship between financial development and income inequality. Moreover, Greenwood–Jovanovich (GJ) hypothesis has also been tested for Iranian economy. Our results confirm the long run relationship between the variables. Furthermore, financial development reduces income inequality. Economic growth worsens income inequality, but inflation and globalization improve income distribution. Finally, GJ hypothesis is found as well as U-shaped relationship between globalization and income inequality in case of Iran.

It is observed that rotational reorientation times vary linearly as function of viscosity. The hydrodynamic stick condition describes the experimental results at low viscosities while the results tend to deviate significantly from it at higher viscosities. This is attributed to the possibility of long chains in solvents hosting a variety of chain defects (end-gauche, double-gauche, all-trans, kink, etc.) thereby reducing the effective length of the molecule, leading to a slightly reduced friction. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) hydrodynamic theory as well as the quasi-hydrodynamic theories of Gierer-Wirtz (GW) and Dote-Kivelson-Shwartz (DKS).

While this evidence lends some support in favor of using song over spoken directives in facilitating engagement and receptive intervention in ASD, there has been little research that has investigated the efficacy of such stimuli on socio-communicative responsiveness measures. Here, we present preliminary results from a pilot study which tested whether sung instruction, as compared to spoken directives, could elicit greater number of socio-communicative behaviors in young children with ASD. Using an adapted single-subject design, three children between the ages of 3 and 4 years, participated in a programme consisting of 18 sessions, of which 9 were delivered with spoken directives and 9 with sung. Sessions were counterbalanced and randomized for three play activities—block matching, picture matching and clay play. All sessions were video-recorded for post-hoc observational coding of three behavioral metrics which included performance, frequency of social gesture and eye contact. Analysis of the videos by two independent raters indicated increased socio-communicative responsiveness in terms of frequency of social gesture as well as eye contact during sung compared to spoken conditions, across all participants. Our findings suggest that sung directives may play a useful role in engaging children with ASD and also serve as an effective interventional medium to enhance socio-communicative responsiveness. © 2015 Paul, Sharda, Menon, Arora, Kansal, Arora and Singh.",Autism; Eye contact; Joint attention; Socio-communicative responsiveness; Song,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Delhi, 110016, India",English

Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with condom non-use at last sex by the main NPP, as reported by SWs. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported (AOR[95%CIs]). Data were drawn from cross-sectional surveys in Bagalkot District, Karnataka State, South India. Responses by SWs whose main NPPs agreed to enrol in the study and the main NPP enroled were linked; these responses by couples (pairs of SWs and NPPs) were examined to assess sexual risk for HIV/STIs. Overall, this study included 257 SWs and 76 NPPs. The data from 67 couples (88.2%) could be linked. In over a quarter of partnerships, at least one (SW or NPP) partner reported having another type of partner besides each other (and clients of SWs). In multivariable analysis, significantly increased odds of condom non-use at last sex with the main NPP were found for the following key factors: planning to have a child with their main NPP (AOR = 3.71[1.44-9.58]); and having decisions about condom use made by their main NPP (AOR = 9.87[4.03-24.16]) or both equally (AOR = 3.18[1.39-7.80]) (versus by the SWs herself). Our study highlights the potential risk for HIV/STI acquisition and transmission between NPPs and SWs, and between NPPs and their non-SWs wives and other sex partners.

Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the factors that influence well-being and socio-occupational functioning following an acute exacerbation in schizophrenia patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 40 patients during the period from June 2013 to June 2014. The possible effect of gender, duration of illness, duration of untreated psychosis, premorbid adjustment, cognitive impairment, facial affect perception and treatment compliance on well-being, and socio-occupational functioning was examined. Results : About 45% of the individuals experienced below average well-being. On logistic regression analysis poor compliance with medication and poorer cognitive functioning significantly differentiated the patient group with below average well-being from those with an above average well-being. Male gender, poor premorbid adjustment, poor compliance to treatment, poor cognitive functioning, and greater duration of untreated psychosis were found to be associated with a poorer socio-occupational functioning. Conclusion: Clinical interventions focusing on improving cognitive impairment and compliance to treatment could play a role in improving well-being, and socio-occupational functioning in schizophrenia patients following an acute exacerbation.",Schizophrenia; socio-occupational functioning; well-being,"National Brain Research Centre, Manesar, Haryana, 122051, India",English
"Pandey K., Sharma K.P., Sharma S.K.",Histone deacetylase inhibition facilitates massed pattern-induced synaptic plasticity and memory,2015,Learning and Memory,"Massed training is less effective for long-term memory formation than the spaced training. The role of acetylation in synaptic plasticity and memory is now well established. However, the role of this important protein modification in synaptic plasticity induced by massed pattern of stimulation or memory induced by massed training is not well understood. Here we show that increasing the level of acetylation enhances long-term potentiation induced by massed pattern of high frequency stimulation. Furthermore, enhancing acetylation level facilitates long-term memory by massed training. Thus, increasing acetylation level facilitates synaptic plasticity and memory by massed patterns. # 2015 Pandey et al.",,"Department of Futures Studies, University of Kerala, Kariavattom, Kerala, 695 581, India; Department of Mathematics, College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, 695 016, India",English

In this paper we analyse the structural characteristics of the network of the interlocking directorate of National Stock Exchange (NSE) listed Indian companies using the tools of social network analysis to examine the effects of the underlying network on the performance of companies and directors. A component analysis of the network shows that 78.5% of the companies fall under one giant component with the largest island containing 6 companies. The giant component was further analysed for clusters and centrality measures. The results show that the highly boarded directors who constitute just 2.25% of the director population are associated with 42% of the total listed companies which account for 65.5% of the total market capitalisation. The top central actors in both director as well as company networks have been identified.

While the need for change in gender norms is well recognized, the task is highly challenging in terms of intervention design, implementation and assessment of impact. This paper describes a methodology for identification of gender norms, the design of community level intervention, community participation and the assessment of intervention impact in a low income, predominately Muslim community of 600,000 people in Mumbai, India. Formative research focused on in-depth interviews with women, men and couples yielding gender normative statements and assessment of community resources to facilitate change. A Gender Equity Scale (GES) based on this formative research was developed and administered annually for a three-year period to random, cross-sectional samples in the intervention and control communities, and to community based, non-governmental organizations (NGO) staff and Imams (religious leaders) in the intervention community. NGO staff disseminated gender oriented messages to their female constituency through their regular outreach activities and through special events and festivals in the community. Imams disseminated gender messages through lectures on social issues for men attending Friday prayers. The results showed that the NGO staff and Imams, assumed more gender equitable attitudes across time. The intervention was associated with a significant improvement in attitudes towards gender equity in the intervention relative to the control community. Men showed a dramatic change in more positive gender attitudes, while women lagged behind in their GES scores. The meaning of these results are explored and the implications assessed for the generalizability of the methodology for other countries, cultures and communities. © 2015, Society for Community Research and Action.",Community intervention; Gender; Impact; India; Norms,"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",English

AS is a rare and quite recently described recessively inherited ciliopathic disorder which causes progressive sensorineural hearing loss and juvenile blindness, as well as many other organ dysfunctions. Two cognitive abilities were considered; Phonological working memory (WM) and executive functions (EF), both of importance in speech development. Methods: Ten individuals (18–37 years) diagnosed with AS, and 20 individuals with no known impairment matched for age, gender, and educational level participated. Sensory functions were measured. Information about motor functions and communicative skills was obtained from responses to a questionnaire. ToM was assessed using Happés strange stories, verbal ability by a vocabulary test, phonological WM by means of an auditory presented non-word serial recall task and EF by tests of updating and inhibition. Results: The AS group performed at a significantly lower level than the control group in both the ToM task and the EF tasks. A significant correlation was observed between recall of non-words and EF in the AS group. Updating, but not inhibition, correlated significantly with verbal ability, whereas both updating and inhibition were significantly related to the ability to initiate and sustain communication. Poorer performance in the ToM and EF tasks were related to language perseverance and motor mannerisms. Conclusion: The AS group displayed a delayed ToM as well as reduced phonological WM, EF, and verbal ability. A significant association between ToM and EF, suggests a compensatory role of EF. This association may reflect the importance of EF to perceive and process input from the social environment when the social interaction is challenged by dual sensory loss. We argue that limitations in EF capacity in individuals with AS, to some extent, may be related to early blindness and progressive hearing loss, but maybe also to gene specific abnormalities.

"Pandit S.A., Preethi G., Vijaylakshmi C., Wallack D.",Towards Understanding Employability Using Images: An Exploratory Study,2015,Psychological Studies,"This paper examines employability in the context of conceptual and political issues surrounding it. Drawing on self determination theory (SDT), we conceptualize that self and understanding of what the self intrinsically values may have a significant impact on securing employment and sustaining it. This can be best captured through both linguistic forms of self expression like words and languages as well as non linguistic forms like images. Both narratives and images transcend the constraints imposed by discursive practices in alien languages (English, other Indian Languages). However, images and descriptions of self-images give more information teleologically. Since the idea of possibility is inherent in the concept of “employ-ability” images and projection of possible selves is immediate through images. While research has looked at possible selves in the lives of youth, they have not done using images as a tool. In this exploratory study, four colleges were purposively chosen and depending on the feasibility, students selected themselves. To arrest the triggering of stereotypes, the workshop mode was used and the students were given sufficient time to work through a simple task. One hundred forty-three students studying in 2nd and 3rd year of city arts and science colleges were given the task to identify 3 pictures/images that best represent their self. For cross-validation, they were also asked to write a few lines to explain why/in what personal manner, the image represents the word. The words that emerged from the students as descriptions of the images represented the core values of the student/s. The images and the explanations were content analyzed. The themes that emerge are described. The effect of gender is not controlled as this is an exploratory study. We feel that the effect of culture are accentuated in this study and therefore need not be controlled. Although a cross cultural comparison was not done, it certainly could be taken as further area of research. The paper describes the themes and proposes that certain themes may be useful in understanding employability. The limitation of the study and the implications are discussed. © 2015, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Culture; Employability; Metaphors; Self; Youth,"Vinod Gupta School of Management, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal  721302, India",English

It highlights the ‘consumer preferred’ cultural elements in a scenario, where attitude towards advertisement, attitude towards brand and purchase intentions are absolutely relevant. As the paper explores the major ‘message’ elements employed in television advertisement, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) have been conducted to identify a smaller number of factors. It has been found that for Indian consumers, advertising messages that affect brand relationship in television advertisement are Entertainment, Social Values, Individual Values, Product Information and Logic. These factors have been found to be well identified in the message and can be studied individually. There is no study that draws the attention of Indian consumers towards message from cross-cultural context.

Krishnan L.,"Social Exclusion, Mental Health, Disadvantage and Injustice",2015,Psychology and Developing Societies,"Social exclusion is a global multi-dimensional phenomenon that highlights the need for an extended inclusionary attitude in society. The present paper discusses some under-explored components of social exclusion. The major features of social exclusion as laid out in diverse approaches are described. The ways in which exclusion of the mentally ill and disabled, a relatively neglected group, differs from other forms of exclusion are examined. Attention is drawn to the relationship between social exclusion, disadvantage, deprivation and injustice. It is pointed out that poverty, disadvantage and deprivation may lead to social exclusion, but these factors alone do not constitute the dynamics of exclusion. The bilateral relationship between mental health/ill-health and exclusionary factors is discussed, taking into account elements such as stigmatisation, ‘othering’ or ‘otherness’. The injustice aspect of social exclusion is emphasised, and a case is made for redressal of distributive, procedural and interactional injustice with regard to the mentally ill as well as other excluded groups. A different approach is required in the case of the mentally ill and disabled as an excluded group, with greater action-orientation in policy-making. The discussion concludes with the view that remedying the problem of social exclusion in Indian society needs a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on ‘the people as the core’. © 2015, © 2015 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.",disadvantage; injustice; Social exclusion; stigma; ‘otherness’,"Department of Chemistry, University of Calcutta, 92, A.

We analyzed cohort data from 243 male and 129 female PLHIV from Bengaluru, and found 19 % of men and 26 % of women reported moderate or severe FI over a 6-month period. Women reported higher mean depression than men, and lower mean QOL. In multivariate analyses adjusting for HIV stigma and demographic covariates, both male and female PLHIV with moderate to severe FI showed lower mean QOL than those reporting mild to no FI. Male but not female food insecure participants also had higher depression scores in adjusted regression analyses. As ART has improved the physical health of PLHIV, more effort is being invested in improving their psychological well-being. Our results suggest such interventions could benefit from including nutritional support to reduce FI among PLHIV. Resumen: Entre las personas que viven con el VIH en India, no se ha documentado bien la inseguridad alimentaria y su conexión con la depresión y la calidad de vida. Se analizaron datos de un cohorte de 243 hombres y 129 mujeres que viven con el VIH en Bengaluru, y se descubrieron que durante un período de seis meses, 19 % de los hombres y 26 % de las mujures reportaron inseguridad alimentario. Las mujeres reportaron una media de depresión más alta que la reportado por los hombres, y una media de calidad de vida más baja. Análisis multivariado, ajustado por el estigma y por covariables demográficos, demostró que personas que viven con el VIH – tanto hombres como mujeres – con moderada a severa inseguridad alimentaria mostraron menor calidad de vida que aquellos que se reportaron leves. Los masculinos también tuvieron altos niveles de depresión en análisis de regresión ajustada. Como la terapia antirretroviral ha mejorado la salud física de las personas que viven con el VIH, más esfuerzos están siendo invertidos en mejorar el bienestar sicológico. Nuestros resultados sugieren que tales intervenciones podrían beneficiar al incluir apoyo nutricional para reducir la inseguridad alimentaria entre personas que viven con el VIH. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Depression; Food insecurity; HIV; India; Quality of life,"Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, K R Road, Basavangudi, Bangalore, 560004, India; Raja Rajeshwari Medical College and Hospital, Kambi pura, Mysore Road, Bangalore, India",English

Of the top ten causes of disability, five are psychiatric illnesses. Availability and accessibility of psychiatrists as well as treatment facilities is meagre, making pathways to psychiatric care tortuous hence delayed, affecting outcomes negatively.With an attempt to study the pathways to psychiatric care, a cross sectional study was undertaken, on 63 consecutive first contact patients in tertiary care centre in Bangalore, India. Socio demographic details, time taken to reach professional help, and reasons for delay were noted. Pathways to care were recorded using 'WHO pathways to care' proforma.One third of the study population were aged between 31 and 45 years, mostly Hindus. Two thirds of them had received about 10 years of formal education, hailed from urban areas and lived in nuclear families.Majority sought help from trained medical professionals, with almost 40% seeking psychiatric help initially itself. While the choice of consultation was influenced by people in the immediate environment, that of first contact was based on the physician or treating facility. Almost 57% had more than two referrals before reaching the tertiary care centre.Though the urban educated population are well aware of the nature of psychiatric illnesses, need for medical intervention and its availability, there was a delay in seeking help from a tertiary psychiatric centre. There is thus a need to educate medical professionals about timely referral to these centres, as early and appropriate interventions result in a favourable outcome. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Choice of treatment; First contact; Pathways to care; Tertiary psychiatric care,"Department of Speech and Hearing, School of Allied Health Sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, 576104, India; The Com DEALL Trust, # 47, Hutchins Road, 2nd Cross, Cookes Town, Sarvajna Nagara, Bangalore, 560084, India",English

A thorough review of published empirical studies from PubMed, PsycINFO databases, online publications of several organizations, web searches, and several online journals related to PSS of HIV/AIDS orphans have been reviewed. HIV/AIDS orphans from 6 to 18 years, whose either or both parents had died due to HIV/AIDS or were staying with HIV-positive parents were selected for this purpose. Six out of eight studies found low level of PSS in HIV/AIDS orphans and two studies found peer-group intervention very effective to improved PSS in HIV/AIDS orphans. They severely experience negative emotions, behavioral problems, higher levels of psychological difficulties, and poor academic performances due to the reasons like drawn out-of-school, living with an unaffectionate caretaker, inadequate care, child labor, physical and sexual abuse, stigma, and discrimination. The psychological health of HIV/AIDS orphans is at risk, and prevention and intervention efforts are missing for improving their psychological outcomes.

"Kulkarni M., Sommer K.",Language-Based Exclusion and Prosocial Behaviors in Organizations,2015,Human Resource Management,"Organizations can be seen as amalgams of languages that can serve as a source of divisive tensions among employees. In our conceptual model, we draw upon social identity and social exclusion research to propose that linguistic diversity increases the potential for language-based exclusion in multilingual work settings. Language may cue listeners to ethnic or cultural stereotypes as well as negatively affect perceptions of speakers' competence, leading listeners to exclude speakers of certain languages. We contend that when excluded, perception of oneself can be cast in an antagonistic relation to perceptions of others, with detrimental effects on prosocial behaviors. Perceptions of procedural unfairness, a weakened identity, and impaired mood serve to amplify the association between language-based exclusion and prosocial behaviors. However, organizational factors such as positive diversity climate may mitigate experiences with language-based exclusion.

We conducted 22 individual semi-structured interviews and involved 44 research participants in focus group discussions. We used framework analysis to examine ideas about data and data sharing in general; its potential benefits or harms, barriers, obligations, and governance; and the requirements for consent. Both researchers and participants were generally in favor of data sharing, although limited experience amplified their reservations. We identified three themes: concerns that the work of data producers may not receive appropriate acknowledgment, skepticism about the process of sharing, and the fact that the terrain of data sharing was essentially uncharted and confusing. To increase data sharing in India, we need to provide guidelines, protocols, and examples of good practice in terms of consent, data preparation, screening of applications, and what individuals and organizations can expect in terms of validation, acknowledgment, and authorship. © The Author(s) 2015.",data sharing; ethics; India; Mumbai; poverty areas,"Transportation Systems Engineering Group, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, 400 076, India; Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, 400 076, India",English
"Kadali B.R., Vedagiri P., Rathi N.",Models for pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour analysis at unprotected mid-block crosswalks under mixed traffic conditions,2015,Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,"Pedestrian safety is an important aspect while crossing the road and it can be explained by pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour. The statistical models such as multiple linear regression (MLR) is often used to model linear relationships between dependent variable (viz., pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour) and independent variables, due to their ability to quantitatively predict the effect of various factors on the dependent variable. However such linear models cannot consider the effect of several variables on the output variable, due to primary assumptions of normality, linear, homoscedasticity and multicollinearity. In this regard, the non-linear models based on the artificial neural network (ANN), which are free from assumptions of linear models, can be easily employed for obtaining the effect of several input variables on the pedestrian accepted gap size. However, researchers have rarely applied ANN modelling technique for predicting the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour, as the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour depends on several pedestrian, traffic and vehicular characteristics. The ANN based models would be quite useful in establishing relationship between these factors on the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour at midblock crosswalks under mixed traffic conditions. In this direction, the present study adopts both MLR as well as ANN with different pedestrian, traffic and vehicular characteristics to assess the significant contributing factors for pedestrians' gap acceptance behaviour at unprotected mid-block crosswalks under mixed traffic conditions. For this purpose, a video graphic survey was conducted at a six lane divided road at unprotected mid-block crossing in Mumbai, India. The data such as pedestrian (gender and age), vehicular, traffic and pedestrian behavioural characteristics were extracted to model pedestrian accepted gaps. The model results show that pedestrian rolling behaviour has a significant effect on pedestrian accepted gap size. The model results concluded that ANN has a better prediction with possibility to consider the effect of more number of variables on the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour as compared to the MLR model under mixed traffic conditions. However, the quantification of significant contributing variables on pedestrian accepted gap size is easy by MLR model as compared to the ANN technique. So, both models have their own significant role in pedestrian gap acceptance analysis. The developed models may be useful to enhance the existing mid-block crosswalk facilities or planning new facilities by more accurate prediction of the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviour considering the influence of various factors under mixed traffic conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Vengopal K.,Blooming Flowers: A case for developmentally appropriate practice,2015,Journal of Early Childhood Research,"Early Childhood Education in India derives its premise from its sociocultural context. In spite of policies in place for developmentally and contextually appropriate Early Childhood Education, the practices are largely detrimental for this age group. The ray of hope, amidst such a scenario are a few initiatives, one such being the rural preschool “Poo-kal,” situated in a village near the town of silk weavers Kanchipuram, South India. The school’s vision is to provide children with contextual learning experiences through a developmentally appropriate curriculum. The curriculum is flexible and is built keeping in mind interests of the child. Learning is through group activities that promote sustained engagement and collaborative learning in children, which in turn fosters social skills. All learning material is locally available, and is provided by the school. Children engage in productive work which helps them foster creativity as well as a sense of pride in work. The curriculum also provides for quiet time and self-time to help children connect with their inner self. Yoga, traditional music, and art forms help children be connected with their cultural roots, promoting physical and emotional development alongside aesthetic sense. Teachers are engaged learners and act as facilitators. They are patient, kind, and firmly believe that every child is unique and has potential that need to be tapped with love and care. School activities also help foster and strengthen school–community linkages. The school aims for the all-round development of the child body, mind, and spirit by involving the head, heart, and hand in the process of learning. © The Author(s) 2014.",collaborative learning; contextual learning engagement; developmentally appropriate practices; Early Childhood Care and Education in India; group activity; preschool experience; productive work; school–community linkage,"Psychology Department, Delhi University, New Delhi, 110007, India",English

Children in two age groups (6 and 10 years) were observed as they engaged in a variety of social activities. Issues over which conflicts erupted, strategies to deal with them and teachers’ roles were explored. It was found that the amount of conflict was similar across both age groups, with boy-boy conflicts being most frequent. Cross-gender conflicts were significantly greater among the older children. Also, they had larger number of conflicts over facts and opinions than their younger counterparts. Physical aggression as an issue for conflict as well as a strategy to deal with conflict was more common among younger children. The children of both the age groups tended to involve teachers in handling their conflicts. The most common response of teachers toward conflict was to ignore or scold the children.

Sellakumar G.K.,"Effect of slow-deep breathing exercise to reduce anxiety among adolescent school students in a selected higher secondary school in Coimbatore, India",2015,Journal of Psychological and Educational Research,"The present study explored the effect of slow-deep breathing exercise to reduce the level of anxiety among adolescent students. The study was designed as pre test post test control group design. Stratified random sample of 100 adolescent students studying in a higher secondary school was recruited for the study. The selected participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Speilberger's state -trait anxiety inventory was administered to assess the level of anxiety. Slow- deep breathing exercise was taught and instructed the participants to practice 30 minutes every day for a period of 45 consecutive days. A post test was conducted to evaluate the effect of slow-deep breathing exercise after 45 days. The collected data were statistically treated. The result revealed that there is a significant effect of slow deep breathing exercise in reducing the level of anxiety. Hence, it can be concluded that slow deep breathing exercise facilitate to reduce anxiety. Furthermore, slow-deep breathing exercise can be incorporated in the daily activities of school students which will help students to perform well in the academic activities. © 2015, Universitatea din Oradea.

"Ingole R., Ghosh A., Malhotra S., Basu D.",Externalizing spectrum or spectra? Underlying dimensions of the externalizing spectrum,2015,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Background: Major psychiatric disorders have been conceptualized to comprise of two dimensions namely, the internalizing and externalizing spectrum. Externalizing spectrum disorders consist of childhood disruptive behaviour disorders (DBD), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and substance use disorders. They are supposed to share common underlying personality traits. However, there is a need to explore the underlying dimensionality of externalizing spectrum of both disorders and traits in a mixed clinical and nonclinical sample from a non-western cultural-ethnic backdrop. Materials and methods: One hundred consecutive subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) and an equal number of biologically unrelated non-substance-dependent control subjects were recruited for the study. Subjects were examined for evidence of DBD and ASPD using Semi-Structured Assessment for Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA-IV). Validated instruments were used for the assessment of impulsivity, sensation seeking and hostility. Continuous scores generated from these instruments were converted to standardized Z scores to ensure comparability among different types of scales. Data were tested for normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Analysis was done by using principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation. Results: Factor analysis revealed two broad factors underlying the externalizing spectrum. The first factor included conduct, antisocial personality and oppositional defiant disorder. This factor was labelled as disruptive-dissocial. The second factor, which included AD and all personality traits, was labelled as impulsive-hostile. Conclusion: Within the externalizing spectrum, there are at least two distinct underlying dimensions: disruptive-dissocial and impulsive-hostile. If confirmed in other samples as well, this may have important implications for understanding and managing psychiatric and psychological issues. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Alcohol dependence; Externalizing spectrum; Factor structure,"Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, Bangalore, India; Department of Management, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States; Management Department, College of Business Administration, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, CA, United States",English
"Kulkarni M., Lengnick-Hall M.L., Martinez P.G.","Overqualification, mismatched qualification, and hiring decisions perceptions of employers",2015,Personnel Review,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how employers define overqualification and mismatched qualification and whether they are willing to hire applicants whose educational and work experience credentials do not match job requirements. Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws from qualitative interview data from 24 hiring managers across a wide range of US public sector and private industries. Data were analyzed and coded to identify themes related to managers’ perceptions of overqualification, matched, and mismatched qualification, and how these were related to selection decisions. A typology is proposed for categorizing applicant qualification levels and their potential human resource outcomes such as hiring decisions. Findings – Hiring managers report that they are willing to interview and hire individuals whose education or experience exceed a job’s requirements as well as applicants with less than required education, but only if they possess sufficient compensatory experience. Research limitations/implications – Findings may not apply to industries where minimum educational levels are essential or to small organizations with few opportunities for career advancement. Social implications – Given current unemployment and underemployment levels, the findings can inform the job search strategies of job seekers. Overqualified applicants should not refrain from applying to job openings, particularly in organizations with opportunities for advancement and where education is considered an asset. Additionally, applicants should reveal their motivations for pursing positions that are intentional mismatches. Originality/value – In contrast to previous studies conducted during periods of lower unemployment and underemployment, these data include managers’ perceptions of overqualification in a recession and post-recession job market context and thus are especially relevant to today’s employment context. The proposed typology distinguishes between categorizations of qualified, overqualified, and underqualified, and helps refine studies aimed at selection decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Overqualification; Qualitative; Selection decisions; Underemployment,"Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Allahabad, Allahabad, India",English
"Gupta R., Srinivasan N.",Only irrelevant sad but not happy faces are inhibited under high perceptual load,2015,Cognition and Emotion,"Perceptual load plays a critical role in identification and awareness of stimuli. Given the differences in emotion–attention interactions, we investigated the perception of distractor emotional faces in two different load conditions under divided attention with a task based on the inattentional blindness paradigm. Participants performed a low- or high-load task with a string of letters presented against a happy, sad or neutral face (in a circular form) as the background. Participants were asked to identify the face that appeared in the critical trial. Results indicate an interaction between emotion and load. First, identification of faces with happy expression was better than chance and unaffected by load. Second, performance was worse than chance for faces with sad expression in the high-load condition, indicating inhibition of unattended sad distractor faces in the critical trial. This indicates that inhibitory processes during a difficult attentional task under divided attention influence subsequent perception of distractor stimuli especially sad faces. The results have implications for the theories of selective attention as well as the role of emotions in conscious perception. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Distractor evaluation; Distractor faces; Divided attention; Emotions; Inhibition; Perceptual load; Recognition memory,"Tinctorial Chemistry Group, Department of Dyestuff Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, N.

The study is carried out in various solvents at room temperature using absorption and steady-state fluorescence technique. The emission wavelength of 5CMPBA is quite sensitive to the polarity of solvents. With the increase in solvent polarity red shift or bathochromic shift of about 9 nm has been observed. The excited state and ground state dipole moments are estimated using solvatochromic shift method and effect of solvents on spectral properties of the molecule are investigated using Kamlet-Taft multiple linear regression approach. The changes in dipole moment (Δμ) are calculated both from solvatochromic shift method and microscopic solvent polarity parameter (E T N ), and the values are compared. The ground state dipole moment is also evaluated using quantum chemical calculations. The bathochromic shift of the emission spectra and the increase in the excited state dipole moment indicates π∈→∈π∗transitions as well as the possibility of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character in the emitting singlet state of 5CMPBA. The relative quantum yield (Φ), radiative and non-radiative decay constants are calculated using single point method. It is found that the quantum yield of the molecule varies from 11 to 64 % with the change in the solvent polarity indicating the dependency of fluorescence nature on the solvent environment. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Boronic acid derivative; Dipole moment; Relative quantum yield; Solvatochromic shift method,"Institute of Mental Health, Amritsar, Punjab, India; Ranchi Institute of Neuro Psychiatry and Allied Sciences, Kanke Ranche, Jharkhand, India",English

In the central nervous system, melatonin (MT1/MT2) as well as serotonin subtype 2C (5-HT2C) receptors is pharmacologically associated with various neurological disorders. Brain mitochondrial potassium channels have been reported for their role in neuroprotection. This study has been structured to investigate the role of agomelatine, a melatonergic MT1/MT2 agonist and nicorandil, a selective ATP sensitive potassium (KATP) channel opener in renal artery ligation (two-kidney-one-clip: 2K1C) hypertension induced endothelial dysfunction, brain damage and VaD. 2K1C-renovascular hypertension has increased mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), impaired memory (elevated plus maze and Morris water maze), endothelial function, reduced serum nitrite/nitrate and increased brain damage (TTC staining of brain sections). Furthermore, 2K1C animals have shown high levels of oxidative stress in serum (increased thiobarbituric acid reactive species-TBARS with decreased levels of glutathione-GSH, superoxide dismutase-SOD and catalase-CAT), in the aorta (increased aortic superoxide anion) and in the brain (increased TBARS with decreased GSH, SOD and CAT). 2K1C has also induced a significant increase in brain inflammation (myeloperoxidase-MPO levels), acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and calcium levels. Impairment in mitochondrial complexes like NADH dehydrogenase (complex-I), succinate dehydrogenase (complex-II) and cytochrome oxidase (complex-IV) was also noted in 2K1C animals. Administration of agomelatine, nicorandil and donepezil significantly attenuated 2K1C-hypertension induced impairments in memory, endothelial function, nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and brain damage.

Positive mental health was found positively correlated with SPANE P, life satisfaction, personal well-being, flourishing and all four domains of quality of life (physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships and environmental health) and negatively correlated with SPANE N. Well-being measures of flourishing, SPANE P, SPANE-N, all four domains of quality of life (physical health, psychological well-being, social relationships and environmental health) significantly predicted children's positive mental health (49% of variance) and its dimensions like emotional well-being (41% of variance), social well-being (24% of variance) and psychological well-being (47% of variance). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Eudemonic; Hedonic; Positive mental health; Quality of life; Well-being,"Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India",English

The Brief COPE is a well validated scale that has been used extensively to assess coping with cancer, depression, and HIV infection in other settings, but never in India. In this study we translated and validated the 28 item Brief COPE among 299 PLHA in South India, assessing reliability, validity, and cultural appropriateness. Although the original scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (alpha = 0.70) and good convergent validity with depression, the test–retest reliability was marginal (test–retest = 0.6) and the original factor structure demonstrated poor fit in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). An exploratory factor analysis yielded a 16 item scale with five factors (active planning, social support, avoidant emotions, substance use, religion).

Tanksale D.,Big five personality traits: Are they really important for the subjective well-being of indians?,2015,International Journal of Psychology,"This study empirically examined the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and subjective well-being (SWB) in India. SWB variables used were life satisfaction, positive affect and negative affect. A total of 183 participants in the age range 30–40 years from Pune, India, completed the personality and SWB measures. Backward stepwise regression analysis showed that the Big Five traits accounted for 17% of the variance in life satisfaction, 35% variance in positive affect and 28% variance in negative affect. Conscientiousness emerged as the strongest predictor of life satisfaction. In line with the earlier research findings, neuroticism and extraversion were found to predict negative affect and positive affect, respectively. Neither openness to experience nor agreeableness contributed to SWB. The research emphasises the need to revisit the association between personality and SWB across different cultures, especially non-western cultures. © 2015, International Journal of Psychology.

Exact awareness of the paradigm which governs current research activities and chances of likely paradigm shifts which could redefine the research approaches, is very crucial for the actors of scientific community and policy makers. Excellent technologies in IT, even accelerated the scientific and applied ontological pursuit in both academia as well as industry. In this work, network approach is advocated for the identification of innovations, new paradigms and emerging fields in the IT industry in the research area 'engineering'. The network is a scientific network of research publications which reflects the volume and flow of scientific activities. Centrality analysis, path analysis, cluster analysis, etc. are used to identify the key papers of paradigm shifts, emerging fields, relatively important clusters and works respectively. A new metric, flow vergence index is devised for cluster analysis. The paradigm shift identified from this network is RFID technology, related with the supply chain management.

"Goswami P., Nishad S.N., Selvaratnam D.",A deterministic model of a research organization’s evolution and dynamics of performance,2015,Palgrave Communications,"Quantitative descriptions of complex social systems hold promise for many applications such as understanding and quantifying group behaviour, organizational performance and inter-personal interactions. Since social systems are interacting and evolving systems, dynamical modelling of them enables the possibility to study time evolution under different scenarios in a quantitative and possibly predictive framework. There are, however, several challenges in developing such dynamical models, one of which is that unlike in physical systems, it is difficult to identify unambiguous, let alone unique, casual relations in social dynamics. A further major difficulty is in quantifying attributes like performance, personal choice and leadership. Here, we provide such a quantitative model of a sociological system, namely a research organization, with its performance as a dynamical variable. We use the model to study the evolution and sensitivity of the performance of a research organization under different conditions. The performance is measured as the sum of contributions from the individual members of the organization in terms of metrics, such as number of research publications. The individual performances are driven by various benchmarks, personal goals and other processes that respond to time-dependent internal and external factors. The factors that arise from institutional and individual aspects, like institutional average and national benchmark, are represented mathematically to describe the dynamics. The model demonstrates complex behaviour that a research institution can exhibit in response to internal as well as external factors. The model is applied to quantify the roles of various processes like initial selection criteria and leadership response in the institutional dynamics and the categories of performers. The novel feature in our formalism is a somewhat mechanistic, and deterministic, description of a research organization’s evolution over time. Our results demonstrate that a social system such as a research organization can be modelled as an initial and boundary value dynamical system. Unlike qualitative or static models, such a dynamical model allows us to chart institutional trajectories under different organizational conditions. This concept and the methodology can be extended to other social systems—such as electorates or a publicly funded organization—with appropriate dynamical variables. © 2015, Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

Thus, with this background, the present study aims at exploring the nature of hemispheric asymmetry in depression while examining the influence of information processing demands or method of presenting stimuli. Emotional and non-emotional information were presented in split-field and free-viewing paradigm to sub-clinically depressed as well as age and gender matching non-depressed individuals. The findings revealed that both groups showed significant left visual field (i.e. right hemispheric) advantage in processing of emotional and nonemotional information irrespective of depression level. However, this enhanced left visual field bias for processing of emotional information was greater in the depressed group.

When aged rats are given daily the iron chelator, deferasirox, over a period of more than 4 months starting from the 18th month, the age-related accumulation of iron and overexpression of TfR1 and ferritin in the brain are significantly prevented. More interestingly, the chelator treatment also considerably reverses the altered Aβ peptide metabolism in the aging brain implying a significant role of iron in the latter phenomenon. Further, other results indicate that iron accumulation results in oxidative stress and the activation of NFB in the aged rat brain, which are also reversed by the deferasirox treatment. The analysis of the results together suggests that iron accumulation and oxidative stress interact at multiple levels that include transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to bring about changes in the expression levels of TfR1 and ferritin and also alterations in Aβ peptide metabolism in the aging rat brain. The efficacy of deferasirox in preventing age-related changes in iron and Aβ peptide metabolism in the aging brain, as shown here, has obvious therapeutic implications for Alzheimer's disease. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Mukherjee S.,"Structural basis of gender violence in cross-regional marriages: Tale from Haryana, India",2015,Contemporary Perspectives in Family Research,"Purpose – Primary objective of the research is to study the various forms of violence existent in a cross-regional marriage. This form of marriage is the outcome of gendered marriage squeeze as there is discordance between supply and demand of brides in the marriage market of Haryana. Hence, brides are imported into Haryana from far-off poorer regions of the country like West Bengal, Tripura, Assam, Chhattisgarh etc. This implies a big change or adjustment in traditional marriage behaviour for both the host as well as the feeder society. Methodology/approach – Fieldwork was conducted in Haryana and West Bengal to get a first-hand understanding of the research problem. Focussed Group Discussions and In-Depth interviews were conducted to get a nuanced understanding of the issues in hand. An attempt for the first time has been made to study one of the regions, that is West Bengal, which is providing the brides. It is thought provoking to understand the reasons for occurrence of such marriages in West Bengal. Findings – Prevalent socio-economic conditions of Haryana and West Bengal have been analysed to derive the causal factors for such a phenomenon. Haryana is a patriarchal, patrilineal and patrilocal society. Interplay of caste and class has significant repercussions on these brides who are married to the Haryana men. These brides go through a marriage which may not always be violent on the outside but definitely so in the inside. These brides face contestations in their everyday existence. Originality/value – It would be of significance to the researchers in the field of sociology, anthropology, development studies, gender studies and demography. It would also interest human rights activists. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Adverse sex ratio; Cross-regional marriage; Daughter devaluation; Migrant bride; Violence; Vulnerability,"Department of Neurobiology, Caring Sciences and Society, Division of Occupational Therapy, 141 83 Huddinge, Sweden; Medical Faculty, Division of Nursing, Umeå University, Umea, Sweden; Department of Neurobiology, Caring Sciences and Society, Division of Nursing, Huddinge, Sweden; Department of Geriatric Medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Danderyd, Sweden; Department of Neurobiology, Caring Sciences and Society, Division of Physiotherapy, Huddinge, Sweden; College of Physiotherapy, Pravara Institute of Medical Science, Loni, Rahata, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India; School of Nursing and Midwifery, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia",English

There is also a lack of studies focusing on creating sustainable evidence-based practice in the setting of residential dementia care. Methods: The aim of this paper is to describe a model for implementing national evidence-based guidelines for care of persons with dementia in nursing homes. The secondary aim is to outline the nursing home staff experiences during the first year of the implementation process. The intervention had a participatory action research approach. This included educational activities such as: (i) thematic seminars introducing national guidelines for dementia care, (ii) regular unit-based seminars; and (iii) later dissemination of information in reflective seminars and several days of poster-exhibitions. Areas of practice development were selected on each of the 24 units, based on unit-specific needs, and a quality improvement strategy was applied and evaluated. Each unit met ten times during a period of eight months. Data for this study were extracted from the reflective seminars and poster presentations, analyzed using a qualitative content analysis. Results: Findings showed that implementation of guidelines were perceived by staff as beneficial for both staff and the residents. However, barriers to identification of relevant sources of evidence and barriers to sustainable implementation were experienced. Conclusions: One of our assumptions was that dementia nursing homes can benefit from becoming knowledge driven, with care practices founded in evidence-based sources. Our findings show that to be partly true, even though most staff units found their efforts to pursue and utilize knowledge adversely impacted by time-logistics and practical workload challenges.

Pandya S.P.,"Adolescents, well-being and spirituality: Insights from a spiritual program",2015,International Journal of Children's Spirituality,"This paper is a study of adolescents, well-being and spirituality. I have looked at the All Round Training in Excellence (ART-Excel) program for adolescents developed by an international spiritual organisation called the Art of Living Foundation (AOL Foundation). Adolescents participants (n = 396) of this program from four cities - Vancouver, London, Johannesburg and Mumbai - comprised of the sample. An equal number comprised of the control group. The findings suggest that spirituality is generally perceived as having positive mental health and well-being influences for program participants. Logistic regression analyses showed that girls, Hindus (homeland and Diaspora), adolescents in higher monthly expenses brackets, with a better health status, that is no self-declared ailments saw a higher efficacy to the ART-Excel program. The program was in general seen to contribute to well-being, social participation, sense of social duty, relationships, future vision and educational attainment. It is important to recognise the role of spirituality in early adolescents psychological well-being and include discussion of such coping mechanisms in working with this population. Moving this further it is also important for helping professionals to be cognisant of the possible presence and importance of spiritual beliefs in the lives of troubled adolescents such as runaway and homeless youth. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Adolescents; Spirituality; Well-being,"Department of Social Sciences and Humanities, Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India; Program on Human Development and Social Policy, Cells to Society: Center for Social Epidemiology and Health, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States; Academic Research Centers, NORC, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States; Department of Medical Psychology and Psychological Diagnostics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; Department of Psychology, Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States",English
"Desantis A.S., Adam E.K., Hawkley L.C., Kudielka B.M., Cacioppo J.T.",Racial and ethnic differences in diurnal cortisol rhythms: Are they consistent over time?,2015,Psychosomatic Medicine,"Background: Prior research indicates that blacks and Hispanics/Latinos have flatter diurnal cortisol declines across the day, a profile associated with poorer health. The stability of racial and ethnic differences in cortisol levels over time is not well understood, and additional research is needed to establish racial and ethnic differences in psychosocial stress levels as related to changes in cortisol levels. Methods: With data from a community-based study of 152 adults (mean age = 58 years; 53% women; 34% black, 26% Hispanic/Latino), we examined the magnitude of racial and ethnic differences over a 5-year period. Salivary cortisol samples were obtained 3 times per day for 3 days in Years 1, 3, 4, and 5. Life events and chronic stress were assessed by questionnaires in which participants reported on whether they had experienced specific types of events or stress within the past year. Depressive symptoms scales (Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale) were also administered annually. Daily cortisol slopes were calculated by subtracting wakeup cortisol from bedtime levels and dividing by hours awake. Results: Increases in psychosocial stress were associated with flatter cortisol slopes among blacks (β = 0.010) and Hispanics/Latinos (β = 0.014), although including cardiovascular disease risk factors attenuates associations in blacks (β = 0.007; p = .125). Higher income predicts a steepening of cortisol rhythms across the study (β = -0.003; p = .019). Conclusions: Racial and ethnic differences in diurnal cortisol rhythms are stable over time. However, the magnitude of changes in cortisol levels associated with chronic stress levels may vary by racial and ethnic subgroups.

Bhatawdekar M.,Modern parenthood through the eyes of a psychiatrist,2015,Mens Sana Monographs,"Child Psychiatry has always described disorders of childhood. Parents form an important dimension of Child Psychiatry since they present the child's behaviour before the therapist. Modern life is full of increasing competition among children, thereby increasing stress among children as well as parents. Modern parents are overly aware, concerned and anxious about their children's future. As a result children get under the pressure of comparison, competition, ambition and goal-setting. All this typically results in the vicious cycle of parental pressures, miscommunication, generation gap etc. No textbook gives clear-cut guidelines about practical aspects of parenting, which is more an art than a science. Dealing with parents in therapy has to take into consideration their psychological make-up and the way it relates with the child. For professionals it is important to empathise with the parents in therapy and at times to share their own experiences of parenting.",Ambition; Childhood; Competition; Generation gap; Goal-setting; Kahlil Gibran; Life; Parental pressures; Parenting,"Department of Chemistry, CMR Institute of Technology, Kandlakoya, Medchal, Hyderabad, Telangana, 501401, India; Department of Chemistry, Osmania University, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, 500 007, India",English

The Schiff base ligand 4-chloro-2-((4-oxo-4H-chromen-3yl) methylene amino) benzoic acid (L) has been synthesized by the reaction between chromone-3-carbaldehyde and 4-chloro-2-amino benzoic acid. The nature of bonding and geometry of the transition metal complexes as well as ligand L have been deduced from elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-vis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESR spectral studies, mass, magnetic susceptibility and molar conductance measurements. The complexes are found to have ML2 composition and are neutral in DMSO. Based on elemental, conductance and spectral studies, six-coordinated geometry was assigned for these complexes. The ligand L acts as tridentate and coordinates through nitrogen atom of azomethine group, hydroxyl of the carboxyl group and oxygen atom of keto group of γ-pyrone ring. The interaction of Cu(II) complex with CT- DNA was carried out by UV-vis, fluorescence titrations and viscosity measurements. The complex binds to DNA through intercalative binding mode. The nuclease activity of the above metal complexes shows that Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes cleave DNA through redox chemistry. The biological activity of the ligand and its complexes have been studied on four bacteria E.coli, B.subtilis, pseudomonas and Edwardella and two fungi penicillium and trichoderma by well disc and fusion method and found that the metal complexes are more active than the free Schiff base ligand. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Biological activity; Chromone-3-carbaldehyde; DNA binding; DNA cleavage; Fluorescence; Viscosity,"Department of Chemistry, Annamalai University Annamalainagar, Chidambaram, Tamilnadu, 608002, India",English

Dutta S.,Identifying Single or Multiple Poverty Trap: An Application to Indian Household Panel Data,2015,Social Indicators Research,"The paper examines the household asset dynamics in India as well as Indian rural States. The paper contributes to the empirical analysis of poverty trap by investigating the presence of one potential poverty trap to simultaneous poverty trap. The paper uses the India Human Development Survey for the year 1993 and 2005. We use the local polynomial regression with Epanechnikov kernel weights to test the existence of multiple or single equilibrium in asset poverty dynamics. Moreover, we use the partial linear mixed model to test the impact of illiteracy trap and under-nutrition trap on asset dynamics process. Across all the States we find only single dynamic asset equilibrium for rural households. However the nature of the asset dynamics varies from one state to another. We find that, in most of the States, asset accumulation does not take place and welfare dynamics is very poor in rural areas. Further, we find under-nutrition trap uniformly affect the asset accumulation in most of the States. However an illiteracy trap affects the asset level heterogeneously over the income and regional distribution. We find the most deprived States (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh) have the multiple poverty trap compared to richer States. Our result implies that asset dynamics of the household varies in the long term according to the types of traps. Government and policy makers should take pointed policy and programme based on whether the poor are trapped and in what ways. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Asset dynamics; Illiteracy; India; Multidimensional poverty; Multiple equilibrium; Poverty trap; Under-nutrition,"Department of Textile Technology, National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, 144011, India",English

Cotton fabrics were finished with two different types of soil releasing agents, viz. Oleophobol CPR (fluorocarbon based) and Carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC-Na) using Box-Behnken and Full factorial designs, respectively and the effect of factors and their levels on soil release property of fabric was studied. Finished fabrics were tested for two different soils i.e., mustard oil and hot coffee. From soiled and laundered fabrics soil release was evaluated for soil release rating as well as instrumental prediction with K/S value to measure discolouration of fabric due to soil. The CMC-Na salt finished cotton fabric picked up significantly more soil compared to that with Oleophobol CPR which resisted deposition of soil on fabric. Cotton fabrics finished with both of these showed excellent soil release with mustard oil and had better finish durability with Oleophobol CPR. Physical properties were comparable except stiffness which was high in CMC-Na finished cotton. © 2014, Dhiman and Chakraborty; licensee Springer.",Box Behnken design; CMC-Na salt; Fluorocarbon; Full factorial design; K/S value; Oleophobol CPR; Soil release rating,"Department of Clinical Psychology, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi, Kerala, India",English
"Sreehari R., Natarajan G.",Detrimental Impact of Rejection Sensitivity in Marital Relationship,2014,Psychological Studies,"Rejection sensitivity (RS)—the disposition to defensively expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection, could be a potential contributor to the frequent conflicts that disrupt the intimate marital relationship between spouses. High rejection sensitivity (HRS) in one or both the spouses leads to personal distress as well as maladaptive behaviours that strain the marital bond. Repeated misdirected attempts to capture the spouse’s attention, affection and acceptance through behaviours such as questioning, arguing, threatening and crying, end in results contrary to what the high rejection sensitivity spouse actually wanted in the first place. The exasperation, irritation, withdrawal or even real rejection by their spouse confirms the HRS individual’s expectation of rejection. The paper aims to illustrate the role of rejection sensitivity in marital dynamics and explores whether the self-fulfilling prophecy of the rejection sensitive spouses could be reversed through psychotherapy focusing on modifying rejection sensitivity. © 2014, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Marital conflict; Reattribution therapy; Rejection sensitivity,"Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom; School of Psychology, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom; Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Allahabad, Allahabad, India; School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St. Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom; School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom",English

The mechanisms involved are diverse: social identification with a group can impact individuals' beliefs about issues such as their connections with others, the availability of social support, the meaningfulness of existence, and the continuity of their identity. Yet, there seems to be a common theme to these mechanisms: identification with a group encourages the belief that one can cope with the stressors one faces (which is associated with better well-being). Our research investigated the relationship between identification, beliefs about coping, and well-being in a survey (N=792) administered in rural North India. Using structural equation modelling, we found that social identification as a Hindu had positive and indirect associations with three measures of well-being through the belief that one can cope with everyday stressors. We also found residual associations between participants' social identification as a Hindu and two measures of well-being in which higher identification was associated with poorer well-being. We discuss these findings and their implication for understanding the relationship between social identification (especially with large-scale group memberships) and well-being. We also discuss the application of social psychological theory developed in the urban West to rural north India. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Department of Electrical Engineering Indian, Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, 400076, India; School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, 400005, India",English
"Bhardwaj A., Chaudhuri S., Dabeer O.",Design and analysis of predictive sampling of haptic signals,2014,ACM Transactions on Applied Perception,"In this article, we identify adaptive sampling strategies for haptic signals. Our approach relies on experiments wherein we record the response of several users to haptic stimuli. We then learn different classifiers to predict the user response based on a variety of causal signal features. The classifiers that have good prediction accuracy serve as candidates to be used in adaptive sampling. We compare the resultant adaptive samplers based on their rate-distortion tradeoff using synthetic as well as natural data. For our experiments, we use a haptic device with a maximum force level of 3 N and 10 users. Each user is subjected to several piecewise constant haptic signals and is required to click a button whenever he perceives a change in the signal. For classification, we not only use classifiers based on level crossings and Weber's law but also random forests using a variety of causal signal features. The random forest typically yields the best prediction accuracy and a study of the importance of variables suggests that the level crossings and Weber's classifier features are most dominant. The classifiers based on level crossings and Weber's law have good accuracy (more than 90%) and are only marginally inferior to random forests. The level crossings classifier consistently outperforms the one based on Weber's law even though the gap is small. Given their simple parametric form, the level crossings and Weber's law-based classifiers are good candidates to be used for adaptive sampling. We study their rate-distortion performance and find that the level crossing sampler is superior. For example, for haptic signals obtained while exploring various rendered objects, for an average sampling rate of 10 samples per second, the level crossings adaptive sampler has a mean square error about 3dB less than the Weber sampler. © 2014 ACM 1544-3558/2014/12-ART16 $15.00.",Adaptive sampling; Decision tree; Level crossings; Linear regression; Random forest; Rate-distortion curve; Weber's law,"Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Allahabad, India; School of Psychology, Queens University, Belfast, United Kingdom; School of Psychology, University of Dundee, United Kingdom; School of Psychology, University of St. Andrews, United Kingdom",English

Few studies, however, have examined longitudinally when differential treatment effects may be observed and whether differential outcomes are associated with exposure to different risk factors and country of implementation. Also, birth asphyxia as a risk condition has not been well studied. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that there will be differential developmental trajectories favoring those who receive EDI versus a health education intervention in children in rural areas of India, Pakistan, and Zambia.Methods Children with and without birth asphyxia were randomized to EDI or control intervention, which was implemented by parents who received training in biweekly home visits initiated before child age 1 month and continuing until 36 months. Development was assessed in 376 children at ages 12, 24, and 36 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Ages & Stages Questionnaire administered by evaluators blind to intervention assignment and risk condition.Results: Longitudinal mixed model analysis indicated that EDI resulted in better development over 36 months in cognitive abilities, regardless of risk condition, maternal resources, child gender, or country. Psychomotor development and parent-reported general development showed similar trends as for cognitive abilities, but were not statistically different between intervention conditions. Developmental differences were observed first at 36 months of age.Conclusion Early developmental intervention has promise for improving development in children across developing countries when exposed to various risk conditions.

Viswanathan B.,Variations in Women’s Heights across Social and Religious Groups Among Indian States,2014,Social Indicators Research,"This paper uses the Indian National Family Health Survey data for the year 2005–2006 to draw comparisons of height among adult women across regions for minority groups like caste and religion. Inter-personal, regional and temporal comparisons are easier and effective using a non-monetary indicator of well-being like height which is also an indicator of long term nutritional status. The results of this study show that Muslim women have significant height advantage but with substantial variations across Indian states. Compared to Hindu women, differences in mean heights are lower across wealth quintiles and levels of educational attainment among Muslim women.

"Chandra S.R., Issac T.G.",Mirror image agnosia,2014,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Gnosis is a modality-specific ability to access semantic knowledge of an object or stimulus in the presence of normal perception. Failure of this is agnosia or disorder of recognition. It can be highly selective within a mode. self-images are different from others as none has seen one′s own image except in reflection. Failure to recognize this image can be labeled as mirror image agnosia or Prosopagnosia for reflected self-image. Whereas mirror agnosia is a well-recognized situation where the person while looking at reflected images of other objects in the mirror he imagines that the objects are in fact inside the mirror and not outside. Material and Methods:: Five patients, four females, and one male presented with failure to recognize reflected self-image, resulting in patients conversing with the image as a friend, fighting because the person in mirror is wearing her nose stud, suspecting the reflected self-image to be an intruder; but did not have prosopagnosia for others faces, non living objects on self and also apraxias except dressing apraxia in one patient. This phenomena is new to our knowledge. Results: Mirror image agnosia is an unique phenomena which is seen in patients with parietal lobe atrophy without specificity to a category of dementing illness and seems to disappear as disease advances. Discussion: Reflected self-images probably have a specific neural substrate that gets affected very early in posterior dementias specially the ones which predominantly affect the right side. At that phase most patients are mistaken as suffering from psychiatric disorder as cognition is moderately preserved. As disease becomes more widespread this symptom becomes masked. A high degree of suspicion and proper assessment might help physicians to recognize the organic cause of the symptom so that early therapeutic interventions can be initiated. Further assessment of the symptom with FMRI and PET scan is likely to solve the mystery of how brain handles reflected self-images.

Methods The SRQ was administered to 2028 mothers from eight nations at two time points: one and six months postpartum. All data were obtained from the Interactions of Malnutrition and Enteric Infections: Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) study. The sample included women from MAL-ED sites in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania. This study examined three aspects of validity of SRQ scores including (a) structural validity, (b) cross-cultural invariance, and (c) invariance over time. Results A 16-item, one-factor structure with items reflecting somatic symptoms removed was deemed to be superior to the original structure in this postpartum population. Although differential item functioning (DIF) across sites was evident the one-factor model was a good fit to the data from seven sites, and the structure was invariant across the one- and six-month time points. Limitations Findings are based on data from self-report scales. No information about the clinical status of the participants was available. Conclusions Overall, findings support the validity of a modified model of the SRQ among postpartum women. Somatic symptoms (e.g., headaches, not sleeping well) may not reflect internalizing problems in a postpartum population.

Domestic violence is an important consideration for sexual, reproductive, and child health, as it can affect contraceptive behaviors of couples as well as levels of infant mortality. In the present analysis, an attempt has been made to study the relationship between women's experience of domestic violence and couple interaction after controlling for certain socioeconomic and demographic variables using logistic regression. This study looks at data from the National Family Health Survey-III conducted from 2005 to 2006 in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India. Findings reveal that 43% of women suffer from domestic violence in the society as a whole; however, if a couple makes joint decisions in household matters, the prevalence of domestic violence is observed to be 24% less. Education and occupation of women, standard of living, media exposure, and partner's alcoholic behaviors are also found to be possible predictors of domestic violence. © The Author(s) 2014.",Alcohol and drugs; Attachment; Domestic violence,"Centre for Sexuality and Health Research and Policy (C-SHaRP), Chennai, India; Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, United States",English

To help inform development of interventions to enhance ART access, we explored barriers to free ART access at government ART centers for IDUs living with HIV in Chennai by conducting three focus groups (n = 19 IDUs) and four key informant interviews. Data were explored using framework analysis to identify categories and derive themes. We found interrelated barriers at the family and social, health-care system, and individual levels. Family and social level barriers included lack of family support and fear of societal discrimination, as well as unmet basic needs, including food and shelter. Health-care system barriers included actual or perceived unfriendly hospital environment and procedures such as requiring proof of address and identity from PLHIV, including homeless IDUs; provider perception that IDUs will not adhere to ART, resulting in ART not being initiated; actual or perceived inadequate counseling services and lack of confidentiality; and lack of effective linkages between ART centers, needle/syringe programs, and drug dependence treatment centers. Individual-level barriers included active drug use, lack of self-efficacy in ART adherence, low motivation to initiate ART stemming from a fatalistic attitude, and inadequate knowledge about ART. These findings indicate that to facilitate IDUs gaining access to ART, systemic changes are needed, including steps to make the environment and procedures at government ART centers more IDU-friendly and steps to decrease HIV- and drug use-related stigma and discrimination faced by IDUs from the general public and health-care providers. Housing support for homeless IDUs and linkage of IDUs with drug dependence treatment are also essential. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Access to health care; AIDS; Antiretroviral treatment; HIV; India; Injecting drug users,"Department of Nursing, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences, Institute of National Importance, Hosur Road, Bangalore, Karnataka  560029, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences, Institute of National Importance, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences, Institute of National Importance, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Psychiatric Social Work, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences, Institute of National Importance, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; Department of Neuro Rehabilitation & PRS, National Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences, Institute of National Importance, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",English

However, cities in developing countries are characterised by spatial differentiation and segregation due to widening inequality which are detrimental for growth and development of cities and regions. Concern over inequality in urban areas raises moral and ethical issues and demands compensatory and remedial policies to alleviate poorer places. This requires recognition of areas of relative deprivation at smaller scale through proper research. The present study is an attempt to find out patterns of inequality in livability in Aizawl-a fast growing hill city in the Himalayan region of northeastern India. Using data reduction method, levels of objective and subjective dimensions of livability are measured at neighbourhood level. The study found out that centrally located neighbourhoods are more livable in comparison to their peripheral counterparts.

However, measuring and expressing the quality of life in any given setting has proved difficult because it includes multiple dimensions. Further, methods based on questionnaire surveys have to contend with responses that are inexact and difficult to quantify. Here I estimate the quality of life of people living in the Indian city of Delhi using fuzzy sets theory, an approach that is designed to handle inexact or 'fuzzy' outcomes. Using a stratified random sample set of 330 households, I compare different locations in Delhi based on their access to seven basic services that is assumed to depict the quality of life. I found that the majority of services (in particular, the overall maintenance and transport services) are poor in resettlement colonies, unauthorised colonies, and urbanised villages. The quality of services improves in colonies under the jurisdiction of the Delhi Cantonment Board, the New Delhi Municipal Council, and approved colonies of the Delhi Development Authority. The overall patterns suggest that the differences in satisfaction and access are primarily influenced by location, and within each location they are influenced by economic conditions. Over 36 % of Delhi's households, which are classified as 'definitely poor' and 'extremely vulnerable', may be deprived of transport services, around 44 % are deprived of overall maintenance services and over 29 % lack well-maintained green spaces in their neighbourhood.

Earlier studies from our laboratory had clearly established the propensity of monocrotophos, an OPI to alter the physiological and behavioral responses of C. elegans. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of monocrotophos (MCP) on physiological/behavioral and biochemical responses in C. elegans that were maintained on high glucose diet. We exposed the worms through development to high glucose diet (2%) and then treated with sublethal concentrations of MCP (0.5, 0.75, 1.5. mM). We measured the behavioral responses in terms of locomotion, physiological responses in terms of egg laying, brood size, lifespan; morphological alterations; and biochemical responses including glucose content. The worms exposed from egg stage through development to high glucose diet showed enhanced toxic outcome of MCP in terms of physiological, behavioral and biochemical responses. Our studies showed that C. elegans is a good model to study glucose-OPI interactive neurotoxicity since all the responses could be studied at ease in this organism and the outcome could be well extrapolated to those that one would expect in higher animals. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Behavior; Biochemical; Caenorhabditis elegans; High glucose; Lifespan; Monocrotophos; Physiology,"Pharmacology Division, University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, UGC Centre of Advanced Study, Panjab University, Chandigarh 160014, India",English
"Rinwa P., Kumar A.",Panax quinquefolium involves nitric oxide pathway in olfactory bulbectomy rat model,2014,Physiology and Behavior,"Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) is a well known screening model for depression. Panax quinquefolium (PQ) is known for its therapeutic potential against several psychiatric disorders. Nitric oxide (NO), an intercellular messenger has been suggested to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. The present study was designed to explore the possible involvement of NO mechanism in the protective effect of PQ against olfactory bulbectomy induced depression. Wistar rats were bulbectomized surgically and kept for a rehabilitation period of two weeks. PQ (50, 100 and 200. mg/kg; p.o.) alone and in combination with NO modulators like l-NAME (10. mg/kg, i.p.) and l-arginine (100. mg/kg; i.p.) were then administered daily for another two weeks. Ablation of olfactory bulbs caused depression-like symptoms as evidenced by increased immobility time in forced swim test, hyperactivity in open field arena, and anhedonic like response in sucrose preference test. Further, OBX caused elevation in serum corticosterone levels and increased oxidative-nitrosative damage. These deficits were integrated with increased levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α), apoptotic factor (caspase-3) and a marked reduction in neurogenesis factor (BDNF) in both cerebral cortex and hippocampal regions of bulbectomized rats. Treatment with PQ significantly and dose-dependently restored these behavioral, biochemical and molecular alterations associated with OBX. Further, pretreatment of l-NAME with subeffective dose of PQ (100. mg/kg) significantly potentiated its protective effects; however l-arginine pretreatment reversed the beneficial effects. The present study suggests that protective effect of P. quinquefolium might involve nitric oxide modulatory pathway against olfactory bulbectomy-induced depression in rats. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Immobility time; Neuroinflammatory cytokines; Nitric oxide; Olfactory bulbectomy; Oxidative damage,"Prevention Sciences, School of Psychology and Centre for Mental Health and Wellbeing Research, Deakin University, Australia; Department of Psychology, KBP College and Institute for Child and Adolescent Health Research, India",English

This article reviews current approaches and advances within the field of health psychology, and their contribution to the prevention of high priority adolescent health problems and to adolescent health promotion. Advances in adolescent health in Australia are indicated by reductions in mortality, tobacco use, road trauma, early-age alcohol use, illicit drug use, suicide, homicide, and HIV transmission. Within a strategic interdisciplinary public health model, psychologists have contributed to these advances through research identifying the psychological and behavioural processes that influence adolescent health risks, trialling and evaluating behavioural intervention strategies to reduce risk processes, and communicating evidence to advocate the dissemination of effective approaches. Current challenges in adolescent health include high rates of obesity and overweight related to increasing physical inactivity and overconsumption of high-calorie and processed foods, high rates of substance use problems, and rising rates of youth violence and socioeconomic inequalities.

The study being exploratory in nature, focus group was chosen for data collection. Three focus groups were held with boys and girls in the age group 12–18 years who were experiencing the deployment of their father for more than six months. Each group consisted of 6–8 participants. A semi structured interview schedule was prepared for the focus group interviews. Each focus group was audio taped and then transcribed for further analysis. Response themes indicate relocation in the absence of the father, changes in roles and responsibilities, routine changes, not having the parent to help with the homework, participate in activities and provide guidance as major sources of stress. While the relaxation in family rules and discipline is cherished by all, there are reintegration problems when the parent returns. Some adolescents expressed concern about the health and worries of the at-home parent, for most of them the mother or the at home parent is the central figure who helps steer through the multiple deployments. © 2013, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Adolescents; Military deployment; Military families,"School of Education, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Centre for Health Psychology, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",English
"Thomas M., Wardle G.A.",“I’m More Aware of the Body than Ever”: Old Adults’ Experiences of the Psychosocial Significance of Their Bodies,2014,Psychological Studies,"Psychology theorises about the ageing body in terms of physical losses, and recommends transcending the body for satisfactory ageing. This study explored old adults’ conceptions of the ageing body to identify its relevance for their well-being in personal and interpersonal contexts. Ten retired individuals participated in semi-structured interviews and data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Ageing was found to trigger a conflict between the participants’ active self and weakening body. The interviewees defensively attempted to sideline their bodies by preoccupying themselves with mental health and interpersonal issues. However, they realised that their daily experiences (e.g., emotions and interpersonal interactions) depended upon bodily fitness and reciprocally, physical health was affected by lifestyle choices alongside socio-cultural influences. This insight about the biopsychosocial nature of the body empowered the participants to adapt to ageing. Their limitations seemed to motivate them to assume health behaviours, to fight for dignity of self and to empathise with significant others, thus enhancing well-being. Perceptions about the body therefore influenced participants’ health management and relationships. An alternative theorisation of the body as an active contributor to human psychosocial identity will pave way for interventions that sustain quality of life among those experiencing physical decline. © 2013, National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India.",Ageing body; Identity; IPA; Relationships; Well-being,"School of Chemical and Biotechnology, SASTRA University, Thanjavur 613 403 Tamil Nadu, India",English

Amino acid attached phenolic ligands (L) were used as reducing as well as functional capping agents in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The hydrogen bonding functionality of L facilitated the assembling of NTPC in the vicinity of metallic surfaces that leads to complete quenching of NTPC fluorescence. The strong and selective coordination of L with metal ions (Zn2+, Cu2+ and Fe 3+) separates the NTPC from the AgNPs surface that turn-on the NTPC fluorescence. HR-TEM and absorption studies confirm the metal coordination with L and separation of NTPC from the AgNPs surface. Mn2+ showed selective red shifting of NTPC fluorescence after 12 h with all sample. Effects of different amino acid attached phenolic ligands were explored in the metal ion sensitivity and selectivity. This approach demonstrates the multifunctional utility of metal NPs in the development of turn-on fluorescence sensor for paramagnetic heavy metal ions in aqueous solution.

The experimental data reveal that the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence in presence of SDZ is due to the strong interaction in the drug binding site of the respective proteins. The Stern-Volmer plot shows positive deviation at higher quencher concentration for all the proteins and was explained in terms of a sphere of action model. The calculated fluorophore-quencher distances vary within 4∈~∈11 Å in different cases. Fluorescence experiments at different temperature indicate thermodynamically favorable binding of SDZ with the proteins with apparently strong association constant (~104-105 M-1) and negative free energy of interaction within the range of -26.0∈~∈-36.8 kJ mol-1.

"Debnath R.M., Shankar R.",Does Good Governance Enhance Happiness: A Cross Nation Study,2014,Social Indicators Research,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of the countries over the period of 10 years by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA). Based on rational and factual parameters such as freedom of press, freedom of religion, percentage of export in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), index of globalization, life expectancy at birth, gender ratio etc., this paper attempts to measure the efficiency of happiness. A combination of social and economic factors has been used to measure technical efficiency. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it measures the relative efficiency of all the countries included in the study. The nations have been ranked as per their relative efficiency and the peer group has been formed. Second a comparison between the rich and the poor countries have been done to test empirically whether the economic growth enhances the happiness among people. Presently, more than 3,000 studies have been published on happiness and Veenhoven in 2004 created a database called World Database of Happiness. The World Database of Happiness has attempted to present the available research findings on happiness. Part of the findings on happiness in nations is available in 'States of nations'. For the research purpose, States of Nations and the data published by have been considered. Although happiness has been quantified and the existing literature has sufficient empirical evidences of the same, in the present context, the relative efficiency has been calculated for the countries on basis of objective and subjective happiness parameters. As per the literature, happiness has two aspects (1) objective and (2) subjective. Objective parameters are external to the individuals and covers material living parameters viz. GDP growth, income, nutrition, mortality rate, literacy etc. However, Subjective indicators measure the quality of life of the individuals. These are summarized as ""subjective well-being"". The various parameters considered in the study capture different aspects of happiness. The result shows how the government can increase the happiness of the people by analyzing the behavior and expectations. People express their preference explicitly about political parties, religion believes, law and order situation, trust in official institutions etc. Although, the behavior of people largely depends upon availability of goods and services in the market, the government can make budgets according to priority or preferences of people. Another way to increase happiness can be done by analyzing the peer group, which is an outcome of DEA. This shows the nations which are similar in terms of their economic and social conditions. The government can compare the prevailing conditions in different countries that improve the condition in their respective country. This could be an effective method as some of the parameters can be replicable in order to make people happier. The limitation of this study is lack of availability of data for many countries. As the number of countries increases, a change in the relative efficiency can be observed. Therefore, a future study can be conducted where the relevant data can be collected and a more global result can be obtained. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Cluster analysis; Cross national; Data envelopment analysis; Governance; Happiness,"Schizophrenia Research Lab, Department of Psychology, Kent State University, P.O.

The utility of the above paced VFT paradigm in differentiating neuropsychiatric patients from healthy subjects has not been systematically examined. We administered a computerized, paced version of the semantic VFT comprising word generation and word repetition blocks to 24 schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy subjects, both before and during fMRI acquisition. The performance of patients with schizophrenia was significantly inferior to that of healthy control subjects in both the 'pre-scan' and 'intra-scan' sessions of the computerized paced semantic VFT. Specifically, schizophrenia patients generated significantly fewer total responses (VFTR) as well as correct responses (VFCR), but a larger number of 'no response' trials. However, there were no significant group differences in perseverative responses in the pre-scan session or 'intra-scan' sessions. The above computerized task has been reported by us previously to generate a behavioral performance index with hemodynamic correlates (John et al., 2011). Thus, our findings support the use of computerized paced VFT comprising word generation and word repetition blocks in both clinical and research settings. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",FMRI; Hemodynamic; VFT; Word generation; Word repetition,"Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand; National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation; Monash University, Selangor, Malaysia; Lingnan University, Hong Kong, China; Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu, India; Arab Open University, Kuwait; Nagoya University, Japan; University of Karachi, Pakistan; Salgado de Oliveira University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Chonnam National University, Gwangju, South Korea; National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi, Taiwan",English

Farooqi S.R.,The CONSTRUCT OF RELATIONSHIP QUALITY,2014,Journal of Relationships Research,"Relationships form the essence of personality and contribute to the individual's wellbeing. Keeping in view the significance that relationships may have on an individual, it becomes compelling to examine relationship quality, the central guiding force of relationships. Relationship quality - the positive or negative feelings about a relationship - is termed an ambiguous concept. The purpose of this article is to review the literature of relationship quality to develop a deep understanding of the construct, by exploring its various determinants. The article begins with a description of the construct followed by a detailed exploration of the factors that determine relationship quality. Research suggests that a wide range of factors have an influence on relationship quality. These include, among others, self-verification and self-enhancement, personality, emotional intelligence, interaction patterns, and partner support. Economic factors also play an important role in determining relationship quality. Previous research also suggests that most of the research on relationship quality has been done on either marital relationships or dating relationships. Further, the determinants of relationship quality may be different with respect to different types of relationships. Additionally, research suggests that relationship quality has been examined using multiple methods, which strengthens the claim of relationship quality being a complex and ambiguous construct. © The Author(s), published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Australian Academic Press Pty Ltd 2014.",determinants of relationship quality; relationship quality; relationships,"Department of Psychology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Faculty of Management, The University of British Columbia, Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, Canada; Centre for the Study of Social Systems, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India",English

Using social dominance theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) and the dual process model (Duckitt, 2001) as guiding theoretical frameworks, we tested four related hypotheses within a sample of 385 Indian university students. In particular we expected that social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) would both make relatively strong and independent contributions to participants’ endorsement of Karma (H1), as well as their support for antiegalitarian social policies and conventions (H2). We also predicted that endorsement of Karma, itself, would be strongly related to support for these policies, net of the influence of SDO, RWA, as well as generalized prejudice (H3). Finally, and consistent with the notion that Karma functions as a legitimizing ideology, we hypothesized that it would at least partially mediate, net of generalized prejudice, the relationships between SDO and RWA, on the one hand, and antiegalitarian and conventional social policies, on the other (H4). Results of latent variable structural equation modeling provided support for all four hypotheses. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2014, PsychOpen.

"Singh N., Mishra R.K.",The modulatory role of second language proficiency on performance monitoring: Evidence from a saccadic countermanding task in high and low proficient bilinguals,2014,Frontiers in Psychology,"We compared Hindi-English bilinguals differing in their L2 proficiency on a saccadic countermanding task which taps inhibitory control as well as monitoring. We particularly explored whether response inhibition and performance monitoring within the oculomotor domain are affected by language proficiency in bilinguals. There were two different oculomotor redirect tasks: Visually Guided Redirect (VGR) task (Experiment1) and Memory Guided Redirect (MGR) task (Experiment 2). In the redirect task, typically a target is presented and the subject is required to make a saccade (no-step trials), unless a new target appears on a different location after some delay from the first target onset (step trials). On such trials participants are required to inhibit and cancel the saccade to the first target and programme a saccade to the new target. Using trial switch reaction time (TSRT), the time taken to inhibit the initiated saccade to the first target as a measure of response inhibition and post-step slowing as a measure of performance monitoring. The results showed the high proficient bilinguals displayed more post-step slowing on the no-step trials as compared to the low proficient bilinguals for both VGR and MGR versions of the task. Secondly, both the high and low proficient bilinguals exhibited comparable TSRT in both VGR and MGR task, showing no modulatory effects of language proficiency on the response inhibition. These results suggest that language proficiency may have an effect on performance monitoring, but not the inhibitory control per se. Thus, we infer that higher proficiency may lead to superior cognitive flexibility and an ability to adjust behavior that facilitates the attainment of the cognitive goal. These findings are in consonance with other current studies that suggest a top-down effect of bilingualism on action control systems. © 2015 Singh and Mishra.",Bilingualism; Inhibition; Performance monitoring; Redirect task; Saccades,"Tinctorial Chemistry Group, Institute of Chemical Technology, N.

Methodology: This is a six month parallel randomized controlled study with sample size of 230 male prisoners. Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to a study or control group by simple random allocation in which random allocation sequence was generated using a random number table. Each individual study participant was involved in a daily program of SK&P for six weeks. Each individual control participant was instructed to sit in an armchair with his eyes closed and gentle attention to their breath for duration of six weeks. To be included in this study, a participant must be a male prisoner diagnosed to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder (except psychosis and bipolar affective disorder [BPAD]) by ICD-10 (DCR) criteria with age between 18 and 65 years. Results: Majority of subjects were unemployed married individuals, educated until undermatric level and not having occupational skills of more than an unskilled labor level. Practicing SK&P for six weeks led to improvement in mean. ±.

Further results were confirmed by UV-globally visible spectrophotometer, DLS and TEM. As 0.5 and 0.85 kb of ssDNA effectively interacted with AuNPs through the van der Waals interaction which consequently led to the prevention of salt induced aggregation, EtBr intercalations as well as fluorescence shift with less binding constant 0.098 and 0.108 μM, respectively. On the contrary, the same length of dsDNA (0.5 and 0.85 kb) not interacted with AuNPs which led to the NPs aggregation, EtBr intercalation as well as fluorescence shift with increased binding constant 0.166 and 0.599 μM, respectively. This approach helped to understand the mode of interactions of DNA with cholate capped AuNPs without any modifications in a simple method and the results could be readout through the naked eye under the UV transilluminator.

"Jha S.D., Singh K.",Spiritual well being and culture: Relationship with urbanization in north India,2014,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"Research on spirituality is gathering momentum nowadays, and examining the concept in the Indian cultural context would give an insight into how a traditionally collectivist culture responds to spirituality. An evident trend in the country is that of urbanization. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between spiritual well-being and collectivism in India with regard to their relationship with urbanization. Some 400 students-200 male and 200 female-from four differently urbanized places in north India were asked to complete the Individualism-Collectivism Scale, and JAREL Spiritual Well-Being Scale. The results indicated that spiritual well-being and collectivism were significantly positively correlated. Urbanization was also significantly related with both variables. Both collectivism and spiritual well-being were lower in places in north India that are more urbanized. This study proves to be an exploratory investigation that provides insights into the relationship between these two constructs understood with reference to their relationship with urbanization. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Collectivism; Spiritual well being; Urbanization,"Maharashtra Institute of Mental Health, Pune, India; NIMHANS, Bangalore, India",English
"Pinjarkar R., Mehrotra S.",Meaning in life and well-being in the lives of college going Indian youth,2014,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"There are a few studies from India that throw light on sources of meaning in life as well as presence and search for meaning and its links to indices of well-being in young adults. The differential association of well-being indices with meaning variables has also not been well documented in the Indian literature. The present study was an exploratory one, undertaken to address these issues. It utilized a sample of 93 college going urban youth pursuing varied postgraduate courses. Search for meaning and presence of meaning in life were assessed using a standard questionnaire, while a measure was developed to document sources of meaning in life and perceived level of fulfilment with respect to one's important sources of meaning. To be loved, accepted and trusted by significant persons in one's life emerged as the most important source of meaning in the overall sample, although the sources of meaning with relational themes were endorsed more frequently by women than by men. Presence of meaning was associated with current as well as general experience of affective well-being (positive and negative affect) and cognitive well-being (life satisfaction). On the other hand, the experience of search for meaning co-occurred with reports of higher negative affect in the short term as well as in general. Meaning variables were more strongly associated with affective as compared to the cognitive dimensions of well-being. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Meaning in life and well-being; Presence of meaning; Search for meaning; Sources of meaning,"Tata Motors Finance Ltd., 2403, Lavender, Vijay Garden, Baridih-831017, India; T.M.

"Sinha P., Nara S., Sachan M.",Epigenetic regulation of cancer: A promising approach for cancer diagnosis,2014,International Journal of Cancer Research and Prevention,"DNA methylation as most predominant epigenetic modification is an important regulator of gene expression, and for last few years it has been a topic of considerable interest for its role in carcinogenesis. One of the first epigenetic alterations to be found in human cancer was the low level of DNA methylation (20-60% less overall 5-methyl-cytosine) in tumors as compared with the level of DNA methylation in their normal-tissue counterparts. Analysis of DNA methylation as epigenetic marks can facilitate the development of very accurate biomarkers for detection and diagnosis as well as prognosis of outcomes. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. The most common outcome is hypermethylation, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing. However, global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. New information concerning the mechanism of DNA methylation and its regulation by variety of proteins and enzymes has made this event even more exciting. As methylation occurs early and can be detected in body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors and for determining the prognosis. Many DNA demethylaing agents as well as small interference RNA are used for the treatment of variety of tumors. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Cancer; DNA methylation; Histone modification; Nucleosome,"Department of Psychology, McGill University, 1205 Ave Docteur Penfield, Montreal, QC, H3A 1B1, Canada; Sangath, H No 451 (168), Survey No 50/31, Succour, Porvorim, Bardez, Goa 403501, India; Centre for Global Mental Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London, WC1E7HT, United Kingdom; Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, OX3 7JX, United Kingdom; University of Colorado, Boulder, 345 UCB Muenzinger, Boulder, CO 80309-0345, United States; Department of Psychology, University of Bath, 2 South, Bath, BA2 7AY, United Kingdom; Centre for Chronic Conditions and Injuries, Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India",English

In low resource settings, the dearth of available experts to assess therapy quality potentially leads to a bottleneck in scaling up lay therapist delivered psychological treatments. Peer-led supervision and the assessment of therapy quality may be one solution to address this barrier. The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to assess lay therapist quality ratings compared to expert supervisors in a multisite study where lay therapists delivered two locally developed, psychological treatments for harmful and dependent drinking and severe depression; 2) assess the acceptability and feasibility of peer-led supervision compared to expert-led supervision. We developed two scales, one for each treatment, to compare lay therapist and expert ratings on audio-taped treatment sessions (n=189). Our findings confirmed our primary hypothesis of increased levels of agreement between peer and expert ratings over three consecutive time periods as demonstrated by a decrease in the differences in mean therapy quality rating scores. This study highlights that lay therapists can be trained to effectively assess each other's therapy sessions as well as experts, and that peer-led supervision is acceptable for lay therapists, thus, enhancing the scalability of psychological treatments in low-resource settings. © 2014 The Authors.",Competency; Lay therapists; Peers; Supervision; Therapy quality,"Multimodal Brain Image Analysis Laboratory (MBIAL), NIMHANS, Bangalore 560029, India; Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bangalore 560029, India; Department of Clinical Neuroscience, NIMHANS, Bangalore 560029, India; Molecular Genetics Laboratory, NIMHANS, Bangalore 560029, India; Department of Neurophysiology, NIMHANS, Bangalore 560029, India; Department of Physiology, K.S.

Clinical correlates of processing speed abnormalities, especially using the parametric version of DSST is yet to be evaluated comprehensively. In this study, we examined schizophrenia patients (N=66) and demographically matched healthy controls (N=72) using computer-administered parametric DSST (pDSST) with fixed (pDSSTF) as well as random (pDSSTR) conditions and analysed the relationship between pDSST performance and clinical symptoms. Psychopathology was assessed using Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)/Negative Symptoms (SANS) with good inter-rater reliability. In comparison with healthy controls, patients demonstrated significantly lesser number of correct responses (CN) in pDSSTF (t=8.0; p&lt;0.001) and pDSSTR (t=7.8; p&lt;0.001) as well as significantly prolonged reaction time in pDSSTF (t=7.1; p&lt;0.001) and pDSSTR (t=7.0; p&lt;0.001). The difference in CN between pDSSTF and pDSSTR [δCN] was significantly lesser in patients than healthy controls (t=2.61; p=0.01). The pDSST reaction time had significant positive correlation with negative syndrome scores as well as bizarre behaviour score. Significantly greater processing speed deficits in pDSST suggest potential relational memory/visual scanning abnormalities in schizophrenia.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimatric analysis (TGA), UV-vis absorption, optical band gap energy analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), FT-Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were employed to investigate the structural and optical properties of the synthesized core and core/shell nanoparticles. The results of the XRD indicate that the obtained core, core/shell and core/shell/shell nanoparticles crystallized well at ~150°C in ethylene glycol (EG) under urea hydrolysis. The growth of the CaMoO4 and SiO2 shell (~12 nm) around the CaMoO4:Pr core nanoparticles resulted in an increase of the average size of the nanopaticles as well as in a broadening of their size distribution. These nanoparticles can be well-dispersed in distilled water to form clear colloidal solutions. The photoluminescence spectra of core, core/shell and core/shell/shell nanoparticles show the characteristic charge transfer emission band of MoO4 2- (533 nm) and Pr3+ 4f2→4f2, with multiple strong 3H4→3P2, 1D2→3H4 and 3P 0→3F2 transitions located at ~490, 605 and 652 nm, respectively.

To evaluate the modification of CPC by these different sugars during the glycation process the extent of the Maillard reaction, conformational, structural and functional changes were investigated. The behaviour of glycated CPC was monitored by the techniques of UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. Specific fluorescence was employed to characterise the glycation and AGEs. The anti-papain activity of glycated CPC was found to be significantly lower as compared to its non-glycated form. Glycation with ribose led to maximum loss in inhibitory activity. It was found that the incubation of CPC with all the mentioned sugars led to a parallel increase in tryptophan fluorescence as well as in Maillard and other AGEs specific fluorescence values and hyperchromicity in the UV-region. Among the sugars studied comparatively ribose was found to be the most active in inducing structural and conformational alterations in the protein suggesting its high reactivity with protein amino groups. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",AGEs; Anti-papain; Chick pea cystatin; Glycation; Maillard reaction,"Hospital for Mental Health, Vikas Gruh Road, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India",English

The present study seeks to fill the knowledge gap by evaluating sociodemographic factors affecting psychological health and burden in caregivers of patients with unipolar depression. Method: Eighty outpatients with unipolar depression and their primary caregivers were included in the study. The patients were evaluated using clinical interview, DSM-IV TR criteria for Major Depressive Episode, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) and Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The caregivers were evaluated using HDRS and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Results: Caregiver burden was significantly higher in female spouse, employed caregivers and spouse caregivers married within the last one year as compared to caregivers other than wife, those unemployed and those married for more than one year. Caregiver burden in moderate as well as severe depressive episode did not show significant difference, although the more prolonged and non-responsive episodes placed a higher degree of burden on the caregivers.

The visual process is known to be composed of alternating phases of saccadic eye movements and fixation pauses. Descriptive results suggest that during the haptic exploration of objects short movement pauses occur as well. The goal of the present study was to detect these ""explorative stops"" (ES) during one-handed and two-handed haptic explorations of various objects and patterns, and to measure their duration. Additionally, the associations between the following variables were analyzed: (a) between mean exploration time and duration of ES, (b) between certain stimulus features and ES frequency, and (c) the duration of ES during the course of exploration. Methods: Five different Experiments were used. The first two Experiments were classical recognition tasks of unknown haptic stimuli (A) and of common objects (B). In Experiment C space-position information of angle legs had to be perceived and reproduced. For Experiments D and E the PHANToM haptic device was used for the exploration of virtual (D) and real (E) sunken reliefs. Results: In each Experiment we observed explorative stops of different average durations. For Experiment A: 329.50 ms, Experiment B: 67.47 ms, Experiment C: 189.92 ms, Experiment D: 186.17 ms and Experiment E: 140.02 ms. Significant correlations were observed between exploration time and the duration of the ES. Also, ES occurred more frequently, but not exclusively, at defined stimulus features like corners, curves and the endpoints of lines. However, explorative stops do not occur every time a stimulus feature is explored. Conclusions: We assume that ES are a general aspect of human haptic exploration processes. We have tried to interpret the occurrence and duration of ES with respect to the Hypotheses-Rebuild-Model and the Limited Capacity Control System theory. © 2014 Grunwald, Muniyandi, Kim, Kim, Krause, Mueller and Srinivasan.",Active touch perception; Finger exploration; Haptic exploration; Haptic perception process; Movement stops,"Netaji Subhas Open University, India; National Centre for Innovations in Distance Education, Indira Gandhi National Open University, India",English

In India, the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), 13 state open universities and over 200 Distance Education Institutes (DEIs) attached to conventional universities and private/autonomous institutes offering programmes through the distance mode (MHRD, 2013) have all created adequate provisions for learner support services and the systems, rules, regulations and norms have been put in place. However, it is significant that a learner in the ODL system remains away from the teacher and the peer group. Thus, the learner feels isolated (Das & Ghosh, 2011a) and needs the empathy of all the functionaries concerned.It has been our experience at IGNOU that more often than not the functionaries fail to realize the value of a learner and the learner fails to understand the value attributed to him by the ODL system. Without such realization the rules and regulations lose their significance. Hence, inculcation of values is of paramount importance in the functioning of the ODL system.In this article we have discussed about 'inculcation of values' among the 'learners' as well as the 'functionaries' for developing 'best practices' in learner support services in the ODL system.

Impact and Mediating Analyses in a Randomized Controlled Trial,2014,Social Development,"Social resources are considered important protectors in traumatic conditions, but few studies have analyzed their role in psychosocial interventions among war-affected children. We examined (1) whether a psychosocial intervention (teaching recovery techniques, TRT) is effective in improving peer and sibling relations, and (2) whether these potentially improved relations mediate the intervention's impacts on children's mental health. Participants were 428 Palestinian children [10-13 (mean = 11.29, standard deviation SD = .68)-year-old girls (49.4 percent) and boys (50.6 percent)], who were cluster-randomized into the TRT and wait-list control groups. They reported the quality of peer (friendship and loneliness) and sibling (intimacy, warmth, conflict, and rivalry) relations, and posttraumatic stress, depressive and psychological distress symptoms, as well as psychosocial well-being at baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and six month follow-up (T3). Results showed gender-specific TRT intervention effects: Loneliness in peer relations reduced among boys and sibling rivalry reduced among girls. The TRT prevented the increase in sibling conflict that happened in the control group.

Higher social networking was seen amongst the better educated and those with regular income, which in turn positively affected the QOL rating. QOL had a direct, but statistically not significant, effect on SRH. In conclusion, the indirect effects of age on SRH mediated through functional ability, and the effects of SES on QOL mediated through social networking, provide new understanding of how age and socio-economic status affect SRH and QOL. By allowing for measurement errors, solving for collinearity in predictor variables by integrating them into measurement models, and specifying causal dependencies between the underlying latent constructs, SEM provides a strong link between theory and empirics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Functional ability; Quality of life; Self-rated health; Social networking; Structural equation modelling,"Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States; Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Government of India, New Delhi, India; Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, Dr. Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital, New Delhi, India",English
"Gandhi T.K., Ganesh S., Sinha P.",Improvement in Spatial Imagery Following Sight Onset Late in Childhood,2014,Psychological Science,"The factors contributing to the development of spatial imagery skills are not well understood. Here, we consider whether visual experience shapes these skills. Although differences in spatial imagery between sighted and blind individuals have been reported, it is unclear whether these differences are truly due to visual deprivation or instead are due to extraneous factors, such as reduced opportunities for the blind to interact with their environment. A direct way of assessing vision's contribution to the development of spatial imagery is to determine whether spatial imagery skills change soon after the onset of sight in congenitally blind individuals. We tested 10 children who gained sight after several years of congenital blindness and found significant improvements in their spatial imagery skills following sight-restoring surgeries. These results provide evidence of vision's contribution to spatial imagery and also have implications for the nature of internal spatial representations. © The Author(s) 2014.",cognitive development; mental models; visual memory,"ESIC Model Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; NSWIOP, Australia; Department of Neurosurgery, SMS Medical College, Jaipur, India; SMS Medical College, Jaipur, India; Department of Psychiatry, SMS Medical College, Jaipur, India",English
"Jain A., Mittal R.S., Sharma A., Sharma A., Gupta I.D.",Study of insomnia and associated factors in traumatic brain injury,2014,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Objectives: This study is designed to investigate prevalence and risk factors of insomnia in TBI. This study has also tried to explore the connection between insomnia with neuroanatomical localization of TBI as well as depression. Design: Prospective study. Materials and methods: All eligible participants were evaluated initially after two week interval for first 4 weeks and monthly interval subsequently till one year. Demographic and injury characteristics of the participants were assessed on a self-designed semi structured performa. Interviews focused on assessment of severity of TBI, insomnia and depression using GCS, ISI and PHQ-9 respectively. Results: Total 204 patients were included, mean age was 33.34 years. 40.2% participants were found to have insomnia. None of the demographic variables were associated with insomnia except severity and duration of TBI. Moderate TBI patient (70.73%) had significantly higher occurrence of insomnia than the mild cases (19.67%) (P= 0.000, df 1). First three month after TBI witnessed more than half (63.41%) of those patient who had insomnia. This was found statistically significant (P< 0.017). Neuroanatomical localization was also correlated with insomnia. Cerebral contusion was the most common (40.24%) site of impact. Almost half (42.42%) of the patients with insomnia had multiple contusions. 32.84% of the study population had depression. No significant correlation could be established between depression and insomnia. Conclusion: Insomnia is a prevalent condition after TBI requiring more clinical and scientific attention as it may have important repercussions on rehabilitation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Depression; Insomnia; Traumatic brain injury,"University of Limerick School of Medicine, Limerick, Ireland; Cognitive Impairment Research Group, Centre for Interventions in Infection, Inflammation and Immunity (4i), Graduate Entry Medical School, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland; Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Limerick, Limerick, Ireland; Research and Academic Institute of Athens, Athens, Greece; Sligo Mental Health Services, Sligo, Ireland; Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, United States; University of Mississippi Medical School, Jackson, MI, United States; Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States; Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India; Psychiatry for Later Life Service, University College Hospital, Galway, Ireland; Department of Elderly Medicine, Midwestern Regional Hospital, Limerick, Ireland; St John's Hospital, Limerick, Ireland; Department of Geriatric Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland; Department of Geriatric Medicine, Medical Center Alkmaar, Alkmaar, Netherlands; Department of Internal Medicine, Geriatrics Section, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Department of Geriatrics, Gelre Hospitals, Apeldoorn, Netherlands; Edinburgh Delirium Research Group, Geriatric Medicine, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom",English

Identification of clinical subtypes can allow for more targeted clinical and research efforts. We sought to develop a brief method for clinical subtyping in clinical and research settings. Methods: A multi-site database, including motor symptom assessments conducted in 487 patients from palliative care, adult and old age consultation-liaison psychiatry services was used to document motor activity disturbances as per the Delirium Motor Checklist (DMC). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify the class structure underpinning DMC data and also items for a brief subtyping scale. The concordance of the abbreviated scale was then compared with the original Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS) in 375 patients having delirium as per the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4th edition) criteria. Results: Latent class analysis identified four classes that corresponded closely with the four recognized motor subtypes of delirium. Further, LCA of items (n = 15) that loaded >60% to the model identified four features that reliably identified the classes/subtypes, and these were combined as a brief motor subtyping scale (DMSS-4). There was good concordance for subtype attribution between the original DMSS and the DMSS-4 (κ = 0.63). Conclusions: The DMSS-4 allows for rapid assessment of clinical subtypes in delirium and has high concordance with the longer and well-validated DMSS. More consistent clinical subtyping in delirium can facilitate better delirium management and more focused research effort. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2014.",Activity; Assessment; Delirium; Motor; Phenomenology; Subtypes,"Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Hosur Road, Bangalore-560 029, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Hosur Road, Bangalore-560 029, India; Department of Psychiatry, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia",English

Anticonvulsant action of ECT has also been one among the hypothesized mechanisms. Anticonvulsant effect may manifest during ECT in at least two ways (a) increased seizure threshold (b) decrease in seizure duration. In depression, increased seizure threshold has been shown to be associated with better antidepressant response. However, relationship between seizure duration and antidepressant activity has been inconsistent. These issues are not investigated in conditions other than depression. Aims: We examined seizure duration over the course of ECT in schizophrenia patients. Settings and Design: Material for this analysis was obtained from a clinical trial examining the differential efficacy of bifrontal ECT (BFECT) versus bitemporal ECT (BTECT) in schizophrenia patients. As a part of study 122 schizophrenia patients who were prescribed ECT were randomized to receive either BFECT or BTECT. Subjects and Methods: Final analysis was conducted on data from 70 patients, as the rest of the data either had artifact or there was a significant change in medication status. Electroencephalogram seizure duration was noted in each session for these patients. Results: Seizure duration declined significantly from second ECT to 6 th ECT (repeated measures analysis of variance F = 4.255; P = 0.006). When separate analysis was conducted for BTECT and BFECT patients the decline in seizure duration from 2 nd to 6 th ECT was significant only with BFECT (F = 3.94; P = 0.014) and not with BTECT (F = 0.966; P = 0.424).

The experiences and expressions of suicidality among adolescents are often ""hidden"" and occur due to complex and cumulative interactions of multiple factors.A cross-sectional survey assessed self-reported suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and helpseeking behaviour among adolescents attending a pre-university college in Bangalore, India. This formed part of a 2-year teacher training project for Adolescent Mental Health and Suicide Prevention in the college.1087 male and female adolescents aged 16-18 years, completed the Columbia Teen Screen which assessed self-reported suicide attempt/s (lifetime, past 3 months) as well as suicidal ideation (current, past 3 months) and associated intensity, severity and duration. Adolescents' perceptions about the need for help and mental health consultation were also assessed.

The Gap Between Public Policies and Locally Defined Indicators Among Residents of Kodagu, Karnataka (India)",2014,Social Indicators Research,"Improving quality of life (QoL) is one of the main goals of many public policies. A useful tool to measure QoL needs to get a good balance between indicators guided by theories (top-down approach) and indicators defined by local people (bottom-up approach). However, QoL measurement tools often neglect to include elements that define the standard of living at local level. In this paper, we analyse the correspondence between human development index, as an indicator adopted by governments to assess QoL, and the elements defined by local people as important in their QoL, called here local means. Using a free-listing technique, we collected information from 114 individuals from Kodagu, Kartanataka (India), to capture local means defining QoL. We then compared local means with the indicators used by Human development report (HDR) of Karnataka, the main measurement tool of QoL in Kodagu. The list of local means included access to basic facilities and many issues related to agriculture and natural resources management as elements locally defining QoL. We also found that HDR does not capture the means defined by people as indicators of QoL. Our findings suggest an important gap between current QoL's indicators considered by public policies and the means of QoL defined by people. Our study provides insights for a set of plausible local indicators useful to achieve a balance between top-down and bottom-up approaches for the local public policies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Human development index; Human well-being; India; Kodagu; Local means; Quality of life,"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India",English

Drawing from the experiences of 828 participants of this spiritual and meditative technique, the focus is to look at its efficacy to promote well-being. Factors that led the participants to learn this practice were explored. Two scales have been used to understand well-being post program participation: the Well-Being Picture Scale and Meaning in Life Questionnaire. The practice is perceived as effective for stress relief, promoting an overall sense of well-being, increasing optimism, and enhancing coping. Crucial to its efficacy are postprogram self-practice and attendance of follow-up sessions. Based on an analysis of SK&P in the light of models of spirituality, this article proposes a frame for cross-cultural utilization of SK&P as a spiritual practice and technique to promote well-being. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Indic spirituality; Sudarshan Kriya and Pranayama (SK&P); well-being,"Operations Management Group, Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Diamond Harbor Road, Kolkata 700104, India; Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, United States",English
"Basu P., Nair S.K.",A decision support system for mean-variance analysis in multi-period inventory control,2014,Decision Support Systems,"Traditionally inventory management models have focused on risk-neutral decision making with the objective of maximizing the expected rewards or minimizing costs over a specified time horizon. However, for items marked by high demand volatility such as fashion goods and technology products, this objective needs to be balanced against the risk associated with the decision. Depending on how the product performs vis-à-vis the seller's original forecast, the seller could end up with losses due to either short or surplus supply. Unfortunately, traditional models do not address this issue. Stochastic dynamic programming models have been extensively used for sequential decision making in the context of multi-period inventory management, but in the traditional way where one either minimizes costs or maximizes profits. Risk is implicitly considered by accounting for stock-out costs. Considering risk and reward simultaneously and explicitly in a stochastic dynamic setting is a cumbersome task and often difficult to implement for practical purposes, since dynamic programming is designed to optimize on one variable, not two. In this paper we develop an algorithm, Variance-Retentive Stochastic Dynamic Programming that tracks variance as well as expected reward in a stochastic dynamic programming model for inventory control. We use the mean-variance solutions in a heuristic, RiskTrackr, to construct efficient frontiers which could be an ideal decision support tool for risk-reward analysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Efficient frontier analysis; Inventory management; Mean-variance analysis; Risk-reward heuristic; Stochastic dynamic programming,"Biophysics and Structural Genomics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, 1/AF, Bidhan Nagar, West Bengal, Kolkata 700 064, India",English

While studying endogenous as well as overexpressed Grb2-AICD interaction in AD cell models, it was found that Grb2 co-localized to compartments along with AICD. We report now that these vesicles form in a clathrin and dynamin independent manner. Both types of vesicles mature into autophagosomes, merge with lysosomes, and relieve the cells of AICD overload. Inhibiting autophagosome formation results in vesicle accumulation. AICD-level is reduced in Grb2 excess condition in Cycloheximide Chase setup. Reduced caspase activity and apoptosis point toward the fact that the cytotoxic effect of AICD is alleviated by its sequestration in autolysosomes. Hence we state that the entrapping of AICD in Grb2 vesicles and its clearance via autophagosomes is a survival contrivance on the part of the cell. This study unravels, for the first time, the roles of Grb2 in autophagy and in handling toxic protein overload in an AD-like scenario. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

Singh V.,A potential role of reward and punishment in the facilitation of the emotion-cognition dichotomy in the Iowa Gambling Task,2013,Frontiers in Psychology,"The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is based on the assumption that a decision maker is equally motivated to seek reward and avoid punishment, and that decision making is governed solely by the intertemporal attribute (i.e., preference for an option that produces an immediate outcome instead of one that yields a delayed outcome is believed to reflect risky decision making and is considered a deficit). It was assumed in the present study that the emotion- and cognition-based processing dichotomy manifests in the IGT as reward and punishment frequency and the intertemporal attribute. It was further proposed that the delineation of emotion- and cognition-based processing is contingent upon reward and punishment as manifested in the frame of the task (variant type) and task motivation (instruction type). The effects of IGT variant type (reward vs. punishment) and instruction type (task motivation induced by instruction types: reward, punishment, reward and punishment, or no hint) on the intertemporal and frequency attributes of IGT decision-making were analyzed. Decision making in the reward variant was equally governed by both attributes, and significantly affected by instruction type, while decision making in the punishment variant was differentially affected by the two attributes and not significantly impacted by instruction type. These results suggest that reward and punishment manifested via task frame as well as the task motivation may facilitate the differentiation of emotion- and cognition-based processing in the IGT. © 2013 Singh.",Decision making; Instructions; Intertemporality; Iowa Gambling Task; Reward-punishment,"Department of Biochemistry, JIPMER, Puducherry 605006, India; Department of Psychiatry, JIPMER, Puducherry 605006, India; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, JIPMER, Puducherry 605006, India",English

We carried out this study in 103 women (58 with PPD and 45 without PPD) who delivered their child in our institute from December 2010 to November 2011. The study group was evaluated for PPD using Edinburgh postnatal depression scale with a cut-off score of 10. Assessment of fetal well being was done by APGAR score assessed immediately after birth. Serum folic acid, vitamin B12, homocysteine and serotonin was done by ELISA. We found significantly elevated levels of homocysteine in women with PPD as compared to those without PPD, both at 24-48. h as well as six weeks after delivery, although no associations were found with folate and vitamin B12 levels. Also, there was a significant negative correlation between serum homocysteine and serotonin levels in the postpartum depression group with a significant negative correlation between homocysteine and serotonin. Our study showed a significantly lower APGAR score in the infants born to mothers with PPD. Our study also shows that homocysteinemia is associated with PPD whether at the first week or sixth week, while low serum serotonin may play a role in depression during the first week, but may not have a role in depression status at the sixth week.

Better understanding of these various facets of this debilitating illness is imperative in planning treatment, thereby limiting decline in global functioning. Methods: Forty-nine schizophrenia patients with illness duration less than two years comprised the sample. A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and WHO Disability Assessment schedule were administered to assess cognitive functions, psychopathology and global functioning respectively. Results: Cognitive deficit quotient for each patient was calculated. In this cohort 16.3% of patients had less than 25% of cognitive deficits, 38.8% had 25-50% of cognitive deficits, 36.7% had 50-75% of cognitive deficits and 8.2% of patients had more than 75% cognitive deficits. More than 50% of the patients in the present cohort showed deficits in the domains of attention, executive functions and learning and memory. Psychopathology significantly correlated with global functioning. Negative symptoms significantly correlated with cognitive functions of motor speed, attention and executive functions. Step wise linear regression analysis showed that duration of illness, attention (sustained attention), executive function (response inhibition), negative and positive psychopathology predicted level of global functioning at varied levels. Conclusions: Cognitive deficits in multiple domains were observed in the present cohort. Attention and executive functions predicted global functioning.

HIV disease progression is affected by substance use as well as psychiatric illness burden due to both direct as well as indirect factors. Continuing substance abuse with poor drug adherence coexists with psychiatric disorders leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Method: A total of 100 HIV positive subjects comprising of two groups each having 50 subjects with and without substance abuse were assessed using detailed history, mental state examination, WHO schedule for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry (SCAN 2.0) and Beck's Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS). Statistical analysis used Chi-Square test, Fischer's exact test, Student's t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, univariate and multiple regression analysis, univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis. p-Value. <. 0.05 was considered to denote statistical significance. Results: Subjects with substance use disorder had higher rates of psychiatric morbidity (52% vs. 24%, 95% CI. = 0.5200, p<. 0.05). The rate of antiretroviral therapy default was almost double in subjects with substance abuse, as compared to subjects without substance use.

"Mosier K.L., Fischer U., Morrow D., Feigh K.M., Durso F.T., Sullivan K., Pop V.","Automation, task, and context features: Impacts on pilots' judgments of human-automation interaction",2013,Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making,"Human-automation interaction (HAI) takes place in virtually every high-technology domain under a variety of operational conditions. Because operators make HAI decisions such as which mode to use, and when to engage, disengage, monitor, or cross-check automation, it is important to understand their perceptions of how system and situational characteristics affect their interaction with automation. The objective of this study was to examine how systematic variations of automation interface, task and context features influence professional pilots' judgments of HAI situations. Pilots received descriptions of crews interacting with flight deck automation in specific situations and were asked to rate cognitive demands and predict behaviors. Results reflect a complex interplay among automation features, task, and context. Automation features influenced judgments of workload, task management, and potential for automation-related errors; however, the impact of automation on situation awareness seems to be moderated by task features. Unanticipated tasks had broader effects on pilots' judgments than operational stressors. Results suggest that although changes to automated systems may be small in technical terms, their cognitive and behavioral impact on operators may be significant. Performance effects of automation changes in aviation as well as other domains need to be addressed with reference to task characteristics and situational demands. © 2013, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",automation; context features; HAI; human-automation interaction,"Department of Pharmacology, University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, UGC Centre of Advanced Study, Chandigarh 160014, Panjab, India",English
"Arora V., Chopra K.",Possible involvement of oxido-nitrosative stress induced neuro-inflammatory cascade and monoaminergic pathway: Underpinning the correlation between nociceptive and depressive behaviour in a rodent model,2013,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Background Pain and depression are frequent co-morbid disorders. The prevalence rate of depression is several times higher in patients with chronic pain than in the general population but the mechanism underlying this association is unknown. A combination of interactions between neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, oxidative and nitrosative stress and cytokines are thought to take part in pathogenesis of pain as well as depression. Thus, the aim of the present study was two-fold, first to investigate the interplay between nociception and associated depression and second to investigate the protective potential of berberine against the reserpine-induced nociceptive and depressive behaviour and further to explore the role of oxidative-nitrosative stress mediated inflammatory cascade and apoptotic signalling pathway in this dyad. Methods and results Nociception and associated depression were induced by administration of reserpine (1 mg/kg subcutaneous daily) for three consecutive days. This behavioural deficit was integrated with decrease in the biogenic amine (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) levels along with increased substance P concentration, oxidative-nitrosative stress, inflammatory cytokines, NF-κβ and caspase-3 levels in different brain regions (cortex and hippocampus) of the reserpinised rats. Limitation More studies are still warranted in similar rodent models of pain and depression, so, that the present findings can be further substantiated to establish the clinical effectiveness of berberine in a subset of patients suffering from pain as well as depression. Conclusion The findings from the current study suggested that reserpine-induced neurochemical alterations and dysregulation of oxidative-nitrosative stress induced inflammatory cascade underlies the co-morbidity of nociceptive behaviour and associated depression in rats. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Allodynia; Biogenic amines; IL-1β; Pain-depression dyad; Substance P; TNF-α,"School of Sport and Education, Brunei University, D-159 Surajmal Vihar, New Delhi, 110092, India",English

This is the first study that explored the organizational stressors experienced by Indian elite female athletes and the impact on their psychological well-being. Ten participants were interviewed on their experiences with sport organizations in preparation for international tournaments. Drawing on Arnold and Fletcher's (2012) taxonomic classification of organizational stressors in sport performers, a range of first- and second-order themes were identified and categorized. The emergent themes were aligned with the dimensions of psychological well-being (Ryff, 1989a). The study added to the existing literature on organizational stressors by considering them in a different cultural context as well as their link with psychological well-being. Perceived bias and lack of support from the sport organizations, limited access to support staff, and lack of basic training necessities were identified as the most commonly cited stressors. Data analysis led to the emergence of new themes specific to the Indian sports climate, such as, perceived gender discrimination and limited scope for a career in sports for female athletes. Consequently, the stressors resulted in feelings of low environmental mastery and personal growth. Recommendations are made for future research and practical implications for sport organizations and sport psychologists are identified.",Elite athletes; Flourish; India; Psychological well-being; Stress,"University of Mysore, Mysore, India",English
Daraei M.,Social Correlates of Psychological Well-Being Among Undergraduate Students in Mysore City,2013,Social Indicators Research,"This study explores the impacts of social factors on psychological well-being mainly, gender, educational levels of parents, family income, occupation of parents, and family relationships. The research methodology I employed was guided by random sampling techniques; I selected two hundred eighty students, between the ages of, 19 and 22, from both genders, and different socioeconomic and religious backgrounds. These students were selected from a total of 8 governmental and private colleges in Mysore. I prepared a structured questionnaire for gathering the demographic information and assessing relevant social factors. To measure psychological well-being, I administered Ryff's psychological well-being scales (Ryff in J Pers Soc Psychol 57(6):1069-1081, 1989). I used frequencies, distribution, and contingency coefficient to describe the variables such as, age, gender, education, religion, income, occupation and their association with type of colleges The data were statistically tested through a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Post Hoc Test (Duncan's Multiple Range Test) and a t test using (SPSS, version 16). The findings of this quantitative study reveal that there were no gender differences in relation to psychological well-being of students. Educational levels of parents, occupation, income, and family relationships impact students' psychological well-being. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, my work explores multiple social factors in tandem, instead of focusing on one social factor. Second, the current study probes into better understanding of the sociological issues that are related to characteristics of psychological well-being, particularly that of young college -age women and men.

Serum levels of 5-HT were measured at 6-h intervals in 50 women with FMS satisfying American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 criteria (Age 36.6 ± 9.8) as well as 50 healthy control women (Age 32.8 ± 10.5). The FIQR and TPC were used to assess FMS severity. Significantly low serum 5-HT levels were found in patients with FMS throughout the day compared to controls. However, only weak and non-significant circadian variations were found in circulating levels of serum 5-HT in patients with lowest level in morning, whereas in controls the morning values were the highest. Furthermore, morning and mid-night serum 5-HT levels were significantly negatively correlated with FIQR in the patient group. There was no significant correlation in 5-HT values in FMS patients with TPC. However, on multiple regression significant correlation was seen between morning, afternoon and evening 5-HT levels with TPC. We conclude that serum 5-HT levels were low in FMS patients and, only weak circadian variations exist. Low levels of serum 5-HT in patient group throughout the day may explain the complaint of unrefreshing sleep. © 2013 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.",5-hydroxytryptamine; Circadian variations; Fibromyalgia syndrome,"Department of Business Management, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India; Department of Economics, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India; History Department, LR DAV College, Jagraon, India",English

Mukhopadhyay S.,Do public services reach the worst affected children in rural India? An investigation applying the quantile regression method,2013,Child Indicators Research,"In the absence of large scale survey data to form a comprehensive index of child wellbeing in India, we select nutritional status as the sole indicator reflecting overall child well-being, since ability to be well-nourished is the one of the most relevant capabilities, particularly for very young children. A puzzling aspect of child nutrition in India is that it is far worse than in countries with comparable and lower levels of income. This paper attempts to shed light on whether the public sector can be blamed for the poor nutritional outcomes of Indian children. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we have attempted to delineate the roles of private income and public infrastructure in explaining children's well-being in rural areas, as indicated by their nutritional status at various points of the distribution. Who are the children receiving the benefits of public facilities? Do public facilities cater to the worst affected segments of child population? How does private wealth interact with public facilities in determining child nutrition? Do children from wealthier households utilize public facilities better? Alternatively, do public facilities compensate for the absence of private wealth? Do these interaction effects vary at different parts of the distribution of children? Second, we attempt to find out the roles of private income and public facilities in equalizing child well-being.

We aimed to compare SC deficits and their relative independence from NC (neuro-cognition) deficits in remitted schizophrenia patients and matched health controls using comprehensive, culturally sensitive standardized tools. 60 schizophrenia patients meeting modified standardized criteria for remission and 60 age, gender and education matched healthy controls were compared on culturally validated tests of SC-Social Cognition Rating Tool in Indian Setting (SOCRATIS) & Tool for Recognition of Emotions in Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TRENDS) to assess theory of mind, attributional bias, social perception and emotion recognition and NC-(attention/vigilance, speed of processing, visual and verbal learning, working memory and executive functions). Patients had deficits in both SC and NC compared to healthy controls. Deficits in SC were largely independent of NC performance, and SC deficits persisted after adjusting for deficits in NC function. The effect sizes (Cohen's d) for SC deficits ranged from 0.37 to 2.23. All patients scored below a defined cut-off in at least one SC domain. SC deficits are likely to be state-independent in schizophrenia, as they are present in remission phase of the illness.

Psychosocial interventions have an important role to play in treatment. However, there is a lack of controlled studies especially from the non-western world. The present study assessed the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in somatisation disorder using a case control design. Fifteen patients each diagnosed as somatisation disorder as per ICD DCR criteria received six sessions of a specific psychological intervention (designed specifically for the study) or a non-specific psychological intervention along with fluoxetine. The subjects were followed up for 8 weeks. Assessments were carried out at 0, 4 and 8 weeks using structured measures. Mean age of the sample was 33 ± 7.11 years. Both the groups suffered moderate level of depression, anxiety and disability, and high neuroticism and subjective distress as measured on different instruments. A significant improvement was observed in both the groups in all the measures following the intervention. The group receiving the specific interventions showed more improvement.

"Dutta A., Roy R., Seetharaman P.",Course management system adoption and usage: A process theoretic perspective,2013,Computers in Human Behavior,"Software platforms called Course Management Systems (CMS) have been widely deployed in recent times to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of course delivery. Research into how best to derive value from CMS is still in a nascent stage. Based on the well-established finding that actual usage is an important intermediate variable between IT and value, this paper develops a parsimonious bi-dimensional characterization of CMS use, consisting of scale and sophistication of use. It then presents a process theoretic framework that can be used to explain the pattern of evolution of CMS use. These two conceptual developments are applied to the usage patterns of 62 faculty members over a 5 year period at a major Indian business school. Usage was found to become more broad-based over time. Overall sophistication of use remained unchanged for infrequent users but increased among frequent users. This evolution in usage patterns is tied to specific actions and events along the way, allowing us to draw prescriptive lessons to enhance usage in CMS environments and potentially derive more value from this type of technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a value added service from the health department of the government of Karnataka. There is no data on its utilization pattern or its future challenges. This study was conducted from a nodal center in order to understand the above two issues. Materials and Methods: We used a 51-item survey questionnaire that captured data on infrastructure, technical aspects, and connectivity parameters, tele-consultations including emergency services, human resources, and coordination aspects both at the client as well as the nodal centers. Results: Services are operational in 25 district hospitals across the state for the past 3.3 (2.1) years. Space was ear-marked across all the client centers.

We illustrate this method by examining how participants from India (a high power distance culture) and the Netherlands (a low power distance culture) react to being allowed or denied an opportunity to voice their opinions. We argue that one way to evaluate the influence of the assumed cultural differences in power distance is to assign participants to conditions that elicit ""countercultural"" psychological states, that is, conditions that prime low power distance in India and high power distance in the Netherlands. To the extent that the results in the countercultural (experimental) conditions meaningfully differ from those observed in the control conditions in which no values are emphasized explicitly, we gain insight into the psychological dimensions that account for cross-cultural differences in people's reactions. The findings presented indeed suggest that the random assignment of participants to countercultural conditions provides cross-cultural researchers with a powerful tool to examine the causal impact of meaningful psychological dimensions that are presumed to differ across cultures. The results further reveal that when high power distance was emphasized either because of national culture or situational cues, participants showed less strong reactions to the voice versus no-voice manipulation than when low power distance was emphasized as a result of either national culture or situational cues. Implications and limitations of this countercultural-experimental approach for the study of cross-cultural differences as well as the psychology of voice and power distance are discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Countercultural contexts; Cross-cultural differences; Experimental method; Power distance; Voice,"Center for Psychiatric Medicine, North Andover, MA, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Anatomy and Neurobiology, Boston, VA, United States; University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States; Department of Psychiatry, Vermont Center for Clinical and Translational Science, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, VT, United States; Department of Holistic Medicine, G and G Health Care Services LLC, North Miami Beach, FL, United States; Center for Genomics and Applied Gene Technology, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology (IIOAB), Nonakuri, Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, India; Department of Nutrigenomics, LifeGen, Inc., Austin, TX, United States; Department of Psychiatry, University of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, United States; Department of Clinical Neurology, PATH Foundation NY, New York, NY, United States; Department of Management Science and Statistics, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States; Dominion Diagnostics, LLC, North Kingstown, RI, United States; Department of Addiction Research and Therapy, Malibu Beach Recovery Center, Malibu Beach, CA, United States",English

Here we present a case of a male presenting many of these seemingly diverse behaviors and finally diagnosed with reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) by his attending physician. Methods: The use of the dopamine agonist, ropinirole after two weeks showed improvement in terms of sexual behavior but tolerance set in and was discontinued especially when an infraction occurred with the patient's insurance. In this article, we carefully explore the potential of ropinirole to downregulate dopamine receptors causing adenylate cyclase receptor supersensitivity and tolerance a feature of neurotransmitter cross-talk. Based on previous scientific evidence showing KB220Z-nutrigenomic amino-acid therapy (NAAT) to rapidly (post one-hour) activate dopaminergic pathways in both the pre-frontal cortex cingulate gyrus (relapse loci) and ventral tegmental area-caudate-accumbens-putamen (craving and emotion loci) the patient was prescribed NAAT. Results and discussion: Within one week of utilization the repetitive paraphilia was eliminated. There were also a number of other positive effects such as enhanced focus that persisted even after the patient stopped using KB220Z suggesting neuroplasticity (e.g. altruistic thoughts). However, these observed profound benefits require more in-depth study, especially in a large cohort against a placebo. While this report focused on a rapid response rather than long-term benefits previously associated with NAAT, it is somewhat encouraging and longer term required follow-up and larger placebo controlled studies are warranted before any definitive conclusions could be gleaned from this case report. © 2013 Akadémiai Kiadó.",Aggressive sexual behavior; Dopamine activation; NAAT; Repetitive paraphilia behavior; Reward deficiency syndrome (RDS); Tourette's,"Department of Liberal Arts, Indian Institute of Technology, Yeddumailaram, Hyderabad, Andhrapradesh, India; Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TP, United Kingdom",English

The present study sought to compare Indian cancer patients who were aware versus unaware of their cancer diagnosis on a range of patient characteristics, levels of psychological distress and illness perceptions. Methods A sample of 329 Indian cancer patients were interviewed about their understanding of their illness (to assess awareness of a cancer diagnosis) and administered the following measures: the modified Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire. Demographic and medical details were also obtained. Results Over half of the sample (54.1%) was unaware of their cancer diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis predicting perceived diagnostic disclosure indicated that awareness of a cancer diagnosis was associated with being involved in medical decisions, receiving multiple treatments, longer treatment durations, greater perceived understanding of one's illness (illness coherence) and citing a cause for one's illness. Conclusions The results highlight the importance of the context in which decisions about the patient's illness are made (e.g. by whom) as well as illness perceptions relating to patients' understanding of their illness.

"Dutt V., Ahn Y.-S., Gonzalez C.",Cyber situation awareness: Modeling detection of cyber attacks with instance-based learning theory,2013,Human Factors,"Objective: To determine the effects of an adversary's behavior on the defender's accurate and timely detection of network threats. Background: Cyber attacks cause major work disruption. It is important to understand how a defender's behavior (experience and tolerance to threats), as well as adversarial behavior (attack strategy), might impact the detection of threats. In this article, we use cognitive modeling to make predictions regarding these factors. Method: Different model types representing a defender, based on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), faced different adversarial behaviors. A defender's model was defined by experience of threats: threat-prone (90% threats and 10% nonthreats) and nonthreat-prone (10% threats and 90% nonthreats); and different tolerance levels to threats: risk-averse (model declares a cyber attack after perceiving one threat out of eight total) and risk-seeking (model declares a cyber attack after perceiving seven threats out of eight total). Adversarial behavior is simulated by considering different attack strategies: patient (threats occur late) and impatient (threats occur early). Results: For an impatient strategy, risk-averse models with threat-prone experiences show improved detection compared with risk-seeking models with nonthreat-prone experiences; however, the same is not true for a patient strategy. Conclusions: Based upon model predictions, a defender's prior threat experiences and his or her tolerance to threats are likely to predict detection accuracy; but considering the nature of adversarial behavior is also important. Application: Decision-support tools that consider the role of a defender's experience and tolerance to threats along with the nature of adversarial behavior are likely to improve a defender's overall threat detection.Copyright © 2012, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",adversarial behavior; cyber situation awareness; defender; experiences; Instance-Based Learning Theory; tolerance,"Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States; National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Indian Council of Medical Research, Mumbai, India; Population Council, New Delhi, India; Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Baltimore, MD, United States; Division of Global Public Health, Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, San Diego, CA, United States; Center for Global Justice, University of California at San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States; Department of Society, Human Development and Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States",English

India is uniquely affected with an estimated 1 in 3 women facing abuse at the hands of a partner. The current mixed-methods study describes violence-related coping and help-seeking, and preferences for health care-based intervention, among perinatal women residing in low-income communities in Mumbai, India. In-depth interviews were conducted with women who had recently given birth and self-reported recent violence from husbands (n = 32), followed by survey data collection (n = 1,038) from mothers seeking immunization for their infants ages 6 months or younger at 3 large urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Participants described fears and other barriers to abuse disclosure, and there was a low level of awareness of formal support services related to violence. Qualitative and quantitative findings indicated that formal help-seeking is uncommon and that informal help sources are most frequently sought. Quantitative results revealed that, while few (<5%) women had been screened for violence in the health care setting, most (67%) would be willing to disclose abuse if asked. When presented with a list of possible clinic-based violence support interventions, participants endorsed crisis counseling and safety planning as most helpful (90.9%). Findings provide direction for violence-related intervention services for perinatal women. A multipronged approach that includes strengthening the informal support system, for example, neighbors and family members, as well as facilitating access to formal services building on the health care system, warrants exploration in this context. © The Author(s) 2013.",help-seeking; India; interventions; perinatal; violence,"Department of Psychiatry, Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad Road, Nalgonda - 508 001, Andhra Pradesh, India; Maharaja Institute of Medical Sciences, Vizianagram, Andhra Pradesh, India",English

Hardly any studies exist on personality traits and coping methods in this group of individuals. Aims: To study the association of personality traits and coping methods to psychological stress in police personnel. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the constables and head constables working in the Police Department, Vizianagram town, Andhra Pradesh. Materials and Methods: The study sample consisted of 150 police persons. The socio-demographic data was individually collected from them. General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) was used for assessing psychological stress, Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) for personality traits, and Coping Checklist-1 (CCL-1) for eliciting coping methods. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS v 10 software. Results : On screening by GHQ-28, 35.33% of the police were found to be having psychological distress. The socio-demographic variables showed no significant association to psychological stress. Personality traits such as neuroticism, psychoticism, and extroversion and coping methods like negative distraction and denial/blame showed statistically significant association (P<0.05) with psychological stress. The most commonly used coping methods across the sample were social support (72.55%), acceptance/redefinition (64.72%), and problem solving (60.46%). As measured by Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), there was evidence of linear association between certain personality traits and coping methods as well.

"Jaswal S., Logie R.H.",The contextual interference effect in visual feature binding: What does it say about the role of attention in binding?,2013,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,"The effects of blocked versus mixed presentation were tested on visual feature binding, assuming that blocked presentation enhances focused attention, whilst mixed presentation recruits extra attentional resources for intratrial as well as intertrial processing. The contextual interference effect suggests that although performance due to mixed presentation is either similar or worse than blocked presentation when tested immediately, it is better when tested after an interval. We explored whether this robust empirical effect, common in psychomotor performance, would be evident in visual feature binding. Stimuli were conjunctions of shape, colour, and location. Study-test intervals from 0 to 2,500 ms were used with a swap detection task. In Experiments 1A and 1B, participants ignored locations to detect shape-colour bindings. In Experiments 2A and 2B, they ignored shapes to detect colour-location binding. In Experiments 3A and 3B, they ignored colours to detect shape-location bindings. Whilst Experiments 1A, 2A, and 3A used blocked presentation, Experiments 1B, 2B, and 3B used mixed presentation of study-test intervals. The results of these experiments and a replication experiment using a within-subjects design showed that the contextual interference effect appeared when spatial attention was engaged, but not when attention was object based. © 2013 Copyright The Experimental Psychology Society.",Attention; Blocked presentation; Contextual interference; Mixed presentation; Visual feature binding,"Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India",English

Approximately 3000 brothel-based female sex workers (FSWs) are estimated to be working in Nagpur's Ganga-Jamuna red light district. The extent to which brothel madams, known as gharwalis, support HIV/STI prevention for FSWs has not been examined. The present study sought to identify personal, social, and behavioral characteristics of gharwalis in Nagpur as well as enhance our understanding of the gharwali's role in shaping the sexual practices of brothel-based FSWs. Thirty gharwalis participated in a survey that covered personal, social, behavioral, and environmental characteristics. Respondents ranged in age from 29 to 50 years (M = 38.9) and had worked as a gharwali for an average of 5.3 years; 80% had no formal education, 43% had never married, and 30% were divorced or separated, and 93% earned money from their own sex work. Gharwalis managed an average of 4.2 FSWs (range 2-10). Overall, gharwalis reported positive attitudes toward condoms, promoted use of condoms by their FSWs with clients, taught FSWs how to use condoms, knew where to obtain condoms for free, and required HIV testing for their FSWs; however, levels of HIV prevention knowledge were low. Gharwalis also reported providing a range of support services to FSWs who lived in their brothels, including shelter, protection from drunk and aggressive clients and police, emotional support, caring and love, and health care. These data suggest the feasibility of involving gharwalis in brothel-based HIV prevention programs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",brothels; female sex work; HIV prevention; India; madams; sexual risk behavior,"Department of Management, Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Pilani), Pilani Campus, Rajasthan, India",English
Satija S.,Striving beyond a healthy development: An insight from Indian Wisdom,2013,Journal of Human Values,"Attempts to explore and explain the basic nature of human beings in terms of development can be traced back far beyond the origin of modern psychology. The ancient Indian scriptures are, in fact, full of psychological knowledge in all aspects with much deep-rooted and sound philosophical background. Many have made attempts to translate this ancient knowledge into a form acceptable to modern psychology. But still much of the ancient spiritual literature has to be studied and interpreted to uncover many hidden psychological concepts that are much deeper in meaning as well as relevance than what Western psychology has gifted to the world in this modern time. The ancient Indian scriptures, philosophical literature, astrological-astronomical literature and medical literature, in essence, are the reservoir of the knowledge concerning human nature and holistic development. Literary exposition towards development can be found in Indian philosophical systems such as Vaises. ika, Nyaya, Sāmkhya, Yoga, Mīmāmsā, Vedānta and the medical systems given by Charaka and SuÅruta.

Balasubramanian N.,"Gender equality, inclusivity and corporate governance in India",2013,Journal of Human Values,"Equity, equality and inclusivity have been themes of abiding interest to philosophers, politicians, social reformers and activists alike. In the modern Indian context of political and social reformation spearheaded by Gandhi during the first half of the twentieth century, the imperatives of mainstreaming women in public and private spheres of activity was a theme that engaged many scholars and statesmen and attracted his serious concern. Not giving women their due share of responsibility and authority was to him as much a case calling for greater inclusivity as was the exclusion of vast proportions of the population from equal opportunities based on other legacy prejudices of caste, creed, and so on. Despite remarkable progress in many other spheres, countries in general are still way behind in rectifying the gender inequalities that still persist. This article discusses, within the broader framework of equality and inclusivity, the theme of women in corporate governance with particular reference to India. Corporate boards, key instruments in governing corporations, are still too thinly populated with women directors; there is comparatively little representation of women in positions of influence and importance within the bureaucracy associated with corporate legislation and market regulation; active involvement of women in policy-making legislative bodies like the parliament and its committees as well as in the ministerial ranks in post-independent India is minimal. This situation calls for speedy correction in developing countries like India, which can arguably benefit most from such inclusion. © 2013 Management Centre for Human Values.",board composition; Corporate governance; directors; diversity; equality; Gandhi; gender equality; inclusivity; India; Mill; Wollstonecraft; women on boards,"National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bangalore, India",English
Lakshmi K.,Altruism and Dāna: Impact on self and well-being,2013,Journal of Human Values,"In this article, I will attempt to link altruism, a concern of Positive Psychology, a recent branch of psychology, and dāna, the deeply entrenched aspect of Indian thought. These aspects strive towards a connection with the self and well-being. In addition, an association between Indian psychological attributes, especially with reference to the Mahābhārata, and Positive Psychology will be shown. In the Indian context, dāna or the act of giving involves not merely the act of giving material or tangible goods or objects but also involves doing an act, doing something for others in which one has no stake or claim. In other words, the giving involves giving something from the depths of oneself, for the 'good' of another, without expecting anything in return. The cultivation of generosity facilitates a pliancy of mind that allows for the eradication of delusion of a limited self as well as disables greed and hate. In addition to anna-dāna, jala-dāna, bhūmi-dāna, vidyā-dāna and jnana-dāna, the Mahābhārata also talks about sharing with love and affection. A desire for good is a desire for self-satisfaction, bearing a positive therapeutic value for a better, truer, more real self. © 2013 Management Centre for Human Values.",Altruism; dāna; empathy; Mahābhārata; self; well-being,"Department of Psychiatry and Translational Psychiatry Laboratory, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, India",English

Digit ratio measures in adults have been established as potential markers of foetal sex hormonal milieu. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sex-dependent interaction of digit ratio measures and cerebral lateralization as well as their neurohemodynamic correlates using functional MRI (fMRI). Digit ratio measures-ratio of index finger (2D) length to ring finger (4D) length (2D:4D) and difference between 2D:4D of two hands, i.e., right minus left (DR-L)-were calculated using high resolution digital images in 70 right-handed participants (42 men) based on reliable and valid method. fMRI was acquired during the performance of a spatial working memory task in a subset of 25 individuals (14 men), and analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) and the Laterality Index toolbox for SPM8. Men had significantly less bilateral 2D:4D than women. There was a significant negative correlation between right 2D:4D and 2-Back task accuracy (2BACC) in women. A significant sex-by-right 2D:4D interaction was observed in left parahippocampal gyrus activation. Additionally, sex-by-DR-L interaction was observed in left IPL activation. DR-L showed a significant positive correlation with the whole brain Laterality Index (LI), and LI, in turn, demonstrated a significant negative correlation with 2BACC. Our study observations suggest several novel sex-differential relationships between 2D:4D measures and fMRI activation during spatial working memory task performance.

"Tripathi R.C., Ghildyal P.",Selfhood in Search of Godhood,2013,Psychology and Developing Societies,"The article seeks to create a space for the concept of 'self as God' in the discourse on self-psychology. It attempts to understand how the central concept of spiritual or divine self finds expression in the lives of ordinary Hindus and in their cultural practices. It is argued that Hindus seek an intimate relationship with their God and, in the process, attempt to realise divinity in self. The relationship with others, including children, teachers (Guru), nature and God is derived from this overriding idea of oneness of self and God. Some narratives of experiences of this oneness with God are given to anchor the later elaboration and analysis of this idea. Hindu rituals, the worship process, the status accorded to the Guru and to the young child (girl or boy) and even certain cases of healing and communication with family deities, as well as other deities reflect this intimacy with God. It is emphasised that the spiritual self should be seen only as one facet of self which acts in tandem with its other facets. The facet of self that assumes salience is a function of context, person's needs and life stage. © 2013 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.",Cultural concepts; God realisation; Godhood; interdependent; life narratives; moral and dialogic; renunciation; self as God; self-psychology; self-realisation; selfhood; spiritual self; types of self-independent; yoga,"Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, Delhi, India; PGDAV College, University of Delhi, Delhi, India",English

The first section of the article provides the theoretical framework within which the concept is situated in Indian psychology. Drawing from the rasa theory, we explicate how experiencing of worldly emotions can simultaneously be the means of transformation. In the second section, we attempt to bring out the centrality of the emotion of vātsalyam in Indian psyche and its pan-Indian expression by drawing from the literatures in Tamil, Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. The third section of the article uses a short qualitative enquiry to examine contemporary understanding of vātsalyam based on responses of lay persons and artists relating to nature of vātsalyam, their modes of expression of this emotion, its manifestation in various relationships, and their views on the uniqueness of this emotion, or otherwise, to the Indian cultural context © 2013 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.",bhakti; culture; emotion; folk theories; Indian philosophical thought; Indian psychology; indigenous psychology; literary expressions; mamata; parental love; rasa; transformative emotions; vātsalyam,"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, United States; University of Pune, India; Portland State University, United States",English

We sought to assess drinking patterns and adverse outcomes among male drinkers and examine whether the association between drinking patterns and adverse outcomes differ by socioeconomic class. Methods: Population survey of 732 male drinkers screened from 1,899 men, aged 18 to 49 years, randomly selected from rural and urban communities in northern Goa, India. Results: Usual quantity of alcohol consumed by 14.8 % (rural 16.8 %; urban 13.6 %) current drinkers is at high-risk level. About 28.6 % (rural 31 %; urban 27.2 %) and 33.7 % (rural 30.5 %; urban 35.5 %) of current drinkers reported monthly or more frequent heavy episodic drinking and drunkenness, respectively. Lower education and lower standard of living (SLI) were associated with higher usual quantity of alcohol consumption. More frequent heavy episodic drinking was associated with older age, being separated, lower education, and lower standard of living; weekly or more frequent drunkenness was associated only with rural residence. All three risky drinking patterns were associated with common mental disorders, sexual risk, intimate partner violence, acute alcohol-related consequences, and alcohol dependence. Significant interactions between SLI and risky alcohol use patterns suggested an increased risk of intimate partner violence among men with risky drinking and lower SLI. Conclusions: Risky drinking patterns are common among male drinkers in Goa and associated with lower socio-economic class. A range of adverse health and social outcomes were associated with risky drinking across all socio-economic classes. Alcohol policy should target risky drinking patterns, particularly among poorer men, to reduce the health and social burden of alcohol use in India. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Alcohol related consequences; Drinking patterns; Hazardous alcohol use; India; Socioeconomic class,"Department of Clinical Psychology, NIMHANS, Hosur Road, Bangalore 560029, India",English

Through the presentation of data on measurement of psychological well-being in the Indian context, this paper highlights that the nature and the number of dimensions of psychological well-being across different cultures may not fully correspond to the Ryff's model. Self acceptance, mastery and competence, positive relations, engagement, and growth emerged as the four factors on a 20-item measure of psychological well-being developed through two field trials, briefly described in the paper. Further studies are required on this measure. There is also an urgent need for qualitative methods of inquiry to develop an in-depth, culturally-rooted understanding of dimensions of psychological wellbeing as well for developing new assessment tools/modifying existing ones. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Mastery and competence; Positive relations; Self-acceptance; Well being,"Department of Psychology, Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt, Universitäts strasse 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria; UGC-Academic Staff College, Pondicherry University, Puducherry - 605 014, India; Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla - 171 005, India",English
"Renner W., Ramalingam P., Pirta R.S.","Moral universals, ancient culture and Indian youth: Part I -theoretical foundations",2013,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"India is known for her rich, ancient culture and tradition. Based on R. A. Shweder's cultural psychology, Moral Foundations Theory poses that the Moral Foundations of ""Harm/care"" and of ""Fairness/reciprocity"" emphasize individual rights, as being characteristic of Western respondents. African and Asian participants, in contrast, additionally endorse the Foundations of ""Ingroup/loyalty"" and ""Authority/respect"". The Indian culture is presented as an outstanding example of the Moral Foundation of ""Purity/sanctity"", thus, placing high value on the sacredness of humans and animals, and emphasizing eating taboos in order to avoid spiritual pollution. Although many Asian cultures still orient by these cultural values, probably as a result of westernization, empirical tests by Jesse Graham on the basis of an online survey only found small differences between Asian and Western respondents. In Part-I we present additional evidence of theoretical nature from evolutionary viewpoint. The Part-II of this paper review studies on westernization in India and recommends that Indian youth, while accepting the challenge of westernization, should remain aware of their unprecedented cultural and spiritual heritage. Theoretical arguments and empirical findings point to the importance of cultural identity in order to preserve self-esteem, well-being, and coping resources. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Cultural psychology; Intuition; Moral foundations theory; Multilevel selection; Reasoning,"London School of Hygiene and oTropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, United Kingdom; Sangath, Porvorim, Goa 403521, India; Parivartan Trust, Satara, Maharashtra 415001, India; Samarth, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600004, India; National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560029, India",English

The goal of this study was to explore the EMs and coping strategies for alcohol use disorders (AUD). Methods: We conducted semi structured interviews with 29 men with AUD and 10 significant others (SO) in two sites in India. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Results: The former were predominantly married, literate and employed; the latter were predominantly wives, literate and employed. Alcohol consumption and AUDs are seen to be mainly associated with psychosocial stress, with other factors being peer influences, availability of disposable income and drinking for pleasure. They are perceived to result in a range of adverse impacts on social life, family life, personal health and family finances. Various coping strategies were deployed by men with AUD and their significant others, for example avoidance, substitution, distraction, religious activities, support from AA/friends/family, restricting means to buy alcohol and anger management. Reduction/cessation in drinking, improved family relationships, improved emotional/physical wellbeing and better occupational functioning were the most desired treatment outcomes. Conclusion: There are considerable similarities, as well as some key differences, observed between the EMs for AUD in India and those reported from other cultures which have implications for the global applicability and contextual adaptations of evidence based interventions for AUD. © 2013 The Authors.",Alcohol use disorder; Coping strategy; Explanatory model; India,"Department of Psychology, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden; Olin Business School, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, United States; UQ Business School, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States; United States International University, Nairobi, United States; Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Department of Psychology, Sikkim University, Gangtok, India",English

Actors from India, Kenya, Singapore, and USA were instructed to produce vocalizations that would convey nine positive and nine negative emotions to listeners. The vocalizations were judged by Swedish listeners using a within-valence forced-choice procedure, where positive and negative emotions were judged in separate experiments. Results showed that listeners could recognize a wide range of positive and negative emotions with accuracy above chance. For positive emotions, we observed the highest recognition rates for relief, followed by lust, interest, serenity and positive surprise, with affection and pride receiving the lowest recognition rates. Anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and negative surprise received the highest recognition rates for negative emotions, with the lowest rates observed for guilt and shame. By way of summary, results showed that the voice can reveal both basic emotions and several positive emotions other than happiness across cultures, but self-conscious emotions such as guilt, pride, and shame seem not to be well recognized from non-linguistic vocalizations. © 2013 Laukka, Elfenbein, Söder, Nordström, Althoff, Chui, Iraki, Rockstuhl and Thingujam.",Affect bursts; Cross-cultural; Emotion recognition; Non-verbal behavior; Positive emotions; Vocalizations,"University of Aden, Yemen; School of Educational Sciences, S.R.T.M.

It states the most important and overlapping factors and reasons that impacted rural education and caused it to be lagging far behind and so challenging for attaining quick educational reformations or even attaining ""Education for All"" goals in the country in the short run. Factors such as poverty, low rates of enrolment, high dropout rates, socio-cultural traditions, lack of accessible accepted schools, unavailability of female teachers, and institutional factors have been addressed in this paper. In addition, this paper helps to show some of the policies adopted by the government and their impact on rural education, and it helps to prioritize what needs, as a new policy, to be addressed in these areas, especially what is related to poverty fighting, building accessible and even segregated schools for girls, increasing female teachers' recruiting and hiring to persuade girls to schools, and teachers training programs especially for female teachers, as well as raising awareness campaigns of the importance of education in general and girls' education in particular that should target such areas. ©Common Ground, Nabil Khadher M.",Education; Rural; Status,"not available, B7, 1st floor, Suncity, Sector-54, Gurgaon, Haryana, 122002, India; Sharan, Society for Service to Urban Poverty, F-6/8A, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, 110057, India; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Family Service Research Center, The Medical University of South Carolina, McClennan Banks 4th Floor, 326 Calhoun St. STE MC406, Charleston, SC, 29401, United States",English

Given that QOL affects self efficacy which in turn affects behavior, it is relevant to examine QOL among IDUs in the context of HIV prevention, and to study whether discriminations and human rights abuses impact QOL in this population. A cross sectional study was conducted in two research sites in Delhi, India among 343 IDUs recruited through a respondent driven sampling. A Hindi version of the WHOQOL Bref survey along with a survey questionnaire of discrimination were used to interview participants. After controlling for demographic characteristics, experiencing physical and verbal abuse (OR: 0.46, CI 0.27-0.79),arrests and imprisonment for carrying needles and/or using drugs (OR: 0.53, CI 0.31-0.90) and lacking health information (OR: 0.49, CI 0.29-0.85)was associated with lower social QOL, while being denied health care services was associated with lower psychological QOL. The more discrimination experienced, the lower was the quality of life in the social and psychological domains. Participants' perceived well being in the four domains was related to their living conditions, discriminatory acts and to perceptions of social support. Discriminatory acts and abuses appeared to have a greater toll on their psychological well being and social relationships, thus indicating the need for human rights advocacy in order to influence law enforcement practices and to reduce stigma, while expanding social support through an extended comprehensive IDU programme. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Discrimination; HIV/AIDS; India; Injection drug use; Quality of life,"MPT Neurology, Hamdard University, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, New Delhi-62, India; MPT Neurology, AIIMS, New Delhi, India",English

In an extended family system, which is most prevalent in India, a child has a larger universe in terms of the parental as well as the grandparental speech model. The present study examines the relative contribution of socialisation agents, that is, the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather and siblings, to the linguistic environment of the family and the acquisition of linguistic skills in children. Eighty-four boys and girls (M = 32 months) were taken from joint and extended families. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to measure the linguistic environment of the family. A battery of linguistic measures was used to assess the language development of the children. A Multiple Regression Analysis was performed on scores of all five social agents obtained on Linguistic Environment Inventory and three measures of linguistic skill.

It was observed that the former excel in CSE and SWB. The task and role responsibility of a special educator involves higher optimism, creativity, intuition and commitment to teach children with special needs. These responsibilities are not only dependent on the personal preferences and behaviours, but also on the structure and various social stimuli in which these educators work. Thus, the study investigates the special educator's personality traits (core self-evaluation) and their relationship with subjective wellbeing. Core self-evaluation was measured by the CSE scale and subjective wellbeing was measured by the life satisfaction scale and PANAS-X. It was applied to 30 special education teachers and 30 regular academic teachers (age 25 years and above) in mainstream private schools (Delhi/NCR). CSE was positively and significantly related to life satisfaction and positive affect and negatively related to negative affects in both groups.

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in four sub-counties in two districts in Eastern Uganda where 1560 randomly selected respondents (15 years and above) were interviewed. The primary outcome was a derived variable high risk sexual behaviour defined as reporting at least one of eight sexual practices that have been associated with HIV transmission in Uganda and which were hypothesised could arise as a consequence of psychiatric disorder or psychosocial problems. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with high risk sexual behaviour in this population. Males were more likely to have at least one high risk sexual behaviour than females (11.8% vs. 9.1% in the last year). Sex outside marriage was the most commonly reported high risk sexual behaviour. Among males, the factors independently associated with high risk sexual behaviour were: being married, belonging to non-Catholic/non-Protestant religions, poverty, being a victim of intimate partner violence and having a major depressive disorder (MDD). Among females, the factors that were independently associated with high risk sexual behaviour were: being in the reproductive age groups of 25-34 and 35-44 years, not seeing a close relative killed and having experienced war-related sexual torture.

"Dutt V., Gonzalez C.",The role of inertia in modeling decisions from experience with instance-based learning,2012,Frontiers in Psychology,"One form of inertia is the tendency to repeat the last decision irrespective of the obtained outcomes while making decisions from experience (DFE). A number of computational models based upon the Instance-Based Learning Theory, a theory of DFE, have included different inertia implementations and have shown to simultaneously account for both risktaking and alternations between alternatives. The role that inertia plays in these models, however, is unclear as the same model without inertia is also able to account for observed risk-taking quite well.This paper demonstrates the predictive benefits of incorporating one particular implementation of inertia in an existing IBL model. We use two large datasets, estimation and competition, from theTechnion PredictionTournament involving a repeated binary-choice task to show that incorporating an inertia mechanism in an IBL model enables it to account for the observed average risk-taking and alternations. Including inertia, however, does not help the model to account for the trends in risk-taking and alternations over trials compared to the IBL model without the inertia mechanism. We generalize the two IBL models, with and without inertia, to the competition set by using the parameters determined in the estimation set.The generalization process demonstrates both the advantages and disadvantages of including inertia in an IBL model. © 2012 Dutt and Gonzalez.",Alternations; Binary-choice; Decisions from experience; Inertia; Instance-based learning; Risk-taking,"PGIMS, Rohtak, India; MAIMRE, Agroha, Haryana, India; Department of Psychiatry, National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi - 110029, India; Department of Endocrinology, BRIDE, Karnal, Haryana, India",English

"Thakurta R.G., Singh O.P., Bhattacharya A., Mallick A.K., Ray P., Sen S., Das R.",Nature of sexual dysfunctions in major depressive disorder and its impact on quality of life,2012,Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine,"Background: Adequate sexual expression is an essential part of many human relationships, and may enhance quality of life and provide a sense of physical, psychological, and social well-being. Epidemiological and clinical studies show that depression is associated with impairments of sexual function and satisfaction, even in untreated patients. Most antidepressant drugs have adverse effects on sexual function, but accurate identification of the incidence of treatment-emergent dysfunction has proved troublesome. However, few investigators have reported the base rate for disturbances in sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm or ejaculation in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) prior to antidepressant treatment. The purpose of this study is to define the frequency of sexual dysfunction (SD) in 60 patients with MDD and examine the relationship between SD and quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction variables. Materials and Methods: A consecutive series of 24 male and 36 female MDD patients diagnosed by SCID-DSM IV assessment completed a series of psychometric measures including a Sexual Function Questionnaire-Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) which asked about change in sexual interest and function as well as quality of life of life enjoyment using QLESQ-SF. Results: Over 33.33% of men and 42% of women reported decreased sexual interest. Reduced levels of arousal were more common in both men and women (8-22%) than ejaculatory or orgasm difficulties (11-16%). In women, SDs were more than males. Quality of life was more impaired in sample with SDs than those without dysfunction showing significant impact of SD on quality of life. Limitation and Conclusion: Although limited by a relatively small sample of drug-free patients with MDD, and by the absence of a non-depressed comparison sample, these results emphasize the importance of factors beyond specific drug effects in the assessment of SD in drug naive-depressed patients.",Impairment; Major depressive disorder; Quality of life; Sexual dysfunctions,"Business School, Convocation Complex, University of Kashmir-Hazratbal, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India",English
"Ahmad S.M., Mir A.A.",Need for Human Resource Development (HRD) practices in Indian Universities: A key for educational excellence,2012,Journal of Human Values,"Today's education system needs to be global. 'World Class Education' involves a globally accepted high standard of education. Every country needs an increasing number of highly educated people and skilled professionals in order to integrate into the globalization process. These professionals include scholars, philosophers and leaders with vision. Leaders are our human capital. The state must provide opportunities for higher education to create human capital that meets global standards. The overall development of a society is largely determined by the quality of its education, especially higher education. A well-educated, well-trained population could propel a nation towards rapid economic growth. Despite lack of natural resources, countries such as Japan, Korea and Singapore have made rapid economic progress. This was because they invested heavily in education and training. On the other hand, countries such as Nigeria or Congo, despite enormous natural resources, are poor and backward because of large-scale illiteracy and lack of skilled workforce. The aim of education is to create well-trained, competent and progressive individuals who can perform all kinds of tasks and take on a lot of responsibilities. Higher education is the stage of education that takes place at the post-secondary level, and is provided mostly and most meaningfully by universities. A university introduces its students to discussions and debates that prevail in various disciplines and fields of knowledge. The objective of a university is not only to create and disseminate knowledge but also to develop human resources that will accelerate the socio-economic development of the nation. This is possible only when the employees working in these universities are motivated and empowered. To achieve this objective, universities must restructure and redesign their HRD practices and processes. In this background, the present article analyzes the existing HRD practices and processes in 10 leading universities in India and how should these universities go about transforming their HR systems and mechanisms to meet the rapidly changing environmental demands. The research approach and methodology adopted to carry out this study includes collection of primary and secondary data. Primary data has been collected by administering a well-structured and well-designed questionnaire on HRD climate survey developed by XLRI Jamshedpur (India). The questionnaire had been administered to 1,000 respondents selected from the 10 leading universities of India. Data from both the sources were analyzed statistically by applying various statistical tools and techniques to find the conclusions, based on which the guidelines, recommendations and policy implications were made for the improvement of HRD practices in the universities. © 2012 Management Centre for Human Values.",general climate; HRD mechanism; OCTAPACE culture,"Zakir Husain Centre for Educational Studies, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India",English
Panda M.,"Culture, Discursive Practices and Literacy Work in Families: Why is Mathematics Important to Indian Immigrants in UK?",2012,Psychology and Developing Societies,"Indian immigrants bring from their country of origin a habitus that, in part, places them in a specific way in their own family as well as in the society. Being 'middle class Indian' both 'disposes' and also 'positions' a parent differently in relation to 'mathematics education' and its perceived value for their offspring. This serves to motivate the parents to ensure that the children are 'good at maths' as it may further enhance the value of the parents as immigrants in a host country that might in other ways (e.g., linguistically and racially) tend to disenfranchise and marginalise them. The discursive embedding of the history of migration, struggle and sacrifice and the pre-migration cultural capital of Indian immigrants explain how specific trajectories of families and home-based literacy-numeracy practices emerge and how these practices lay down the cognitive and motivational structures that may help Indian children internalise high educational ambitions and the desirable behaviour to achieve these goals. The logic of these literacy practices could be a logic of developing social psychological tools to overcome ethnic, racial and economic disadvantages. © 2012 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.",cultural capital; discursive practice; Family Doxa; Habitus; literacy work; Social capital,"Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Faculty of Family and Community Sciences, M.S.

Out of these six studies, five are from the city of Baroda while one is from Mumbai, both cities in western India. The total sample included 175 fathers, 50 mothers and 120 children. The studies used semi-structured interviews to elicit data from fathers and mothers about 'who is an ideal father'? The study also sought children's notions in the form of responses to open-ended statements. The data was analysed using themes from the generative-fathering framework (Dollahite, 2002; Dollahite and Hawkins, 1997). The results revealed that fathers were most influenced by their own parents in their ideals, followed by close relatives and other sources such as the media, mythology, friends and their respective spiritual gurus. The discussion focuses on understanding the results in terms of change and continuity in fatherhood ideals as well as the use of a generative framework for research on fatherhood. © 2012 Department of Psychology, University of Allahabad.",fathering expectations; gender roles; Ideal father; Indian family,"Lokmanya Tilak Medical College, Sion General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai 400022, India",English
Kalra G.,Talking about stigma towards mental health professionals with psychiatry trainees: A movie club approach,2012,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,Psychiatry as a discipline is often perceived as 'different' by other medical professionals as much as by a common man. This perception of 'difference' may give rise to stigma both towards mental illness and to mental health professionals. Mental health professionals are thus both recipients of stigma and agents who can de-stigmatize psychiatry. A psychiatry movie club approach can be a very useful learning experience to understand various aspects of this stigmatization process. This paper presents a brief account of such an endeavour in which the film Gothika (2003) was used to help psychiatry trainees talk about their experiences with stigma towards mental illness as well as their profession. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.,Cinema; Cinemeducation; Film; Movies; Psychiatry; Psychiatry movie club; Stigma; Training,"School of Social Sciences, Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, UP, India",English
Bhadra S.,"Psychosocial Support for the Children Affected by Communal Violence in Gujarat, India",2012,International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies,"This article explores the various psychosocial problems that children and adolescents experienced due to communal violence in the Indian state of Gujarat in 2002. Five strategies were adapted to provide support and care to the children and adolescents in the relief camps as well as in the community during the rehabilitation phase. Community volunteers were used in the program to facilitate psychosocial healing by using different mediums of expression. Each medium encouraged the expression of thoughts and feelings caused by the trauma and the building of hope for the future. Various community-oriented peace-building measures, which are explained and outlined, were adapted to build trusting inter-community relationships. The peace-building measures focused on rebuilding a nurturing environment by re-establishing community networks and social support systems. Life skills education was one of the approaches adopted for fostering psychosocial development among the children in order to restore peaceful cohabitation for a future based on mutual respect and acceptance. Ultimately, in disaster rehabilitation, rebuilding one's ""sense of place"" through holistic psychosocial support has been highlighted as a model for practice. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Children; Community participation; Conflict; Life skills; Psychosocial; Trauma; Violence,"Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore 560029, India; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, India; Department of Neuroimaging and Interventional Radiology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, India",English

This study aimed to identify WMmicrostructure changes in juvenile OCD. Methods Fifteen children and adolescents with OCDand 15 matched healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging using a 3 Tesla (Achieva, Best, The Netherlands) magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Voxelwise analyses were conducted on data processed through tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: Patients significantly differed from controls in axial as well as radial diffusivities, but not in fractional anisotropy. Patients demonstrated significantly increased axial diffusivity in corpus callosum (genu, body, and splenium), right and left superior longitudinal fasciculi, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, right and left cingulum, bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, bilateral anterior limb of internal capsule, left posterior limb of the internal capsule, and middle cerebellar peduncle. In addition, significantly increased radial diffusivity was seen in patients in genu of the corpus, right and left superior longitudinal fasciculi, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, right and left uncinate fasciculi, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, left posterior limb of internal capsule, right superior cerebellar peduncle, middle cerebellar peduncle, and right inferior cerebellar peduncle. Conclusions Our findings suggest involvement of multiple WMtracts in juvenile OCD. In addition to the widely proposed hypothesis of orbitofrontal-striato- thalamo-cortical circuitry deficits in the development of OCD, our findings suggest involvement of additional brain regions, possibly parietal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, and limbic system. The widespread differences in WMamong cases and controls also points to the possibility of underlying myelination changes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",imaging; neurobiology; obsessive-compulsive disorder; white matter,"HIV and AIDS Program, Population Council, 142 Golf Links, New Delhi 110 003, India; National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Mumbai, India; UNAIDS, Kathmandu, Nepal; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States; University of California, San Diego, CA, United States",English

Cross-sectional analyses of a nationally representative household survey conducted across all 29 states of India from 2005 to 2006 via the National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3) included a subsample of 27,771 married couples who were tested for HIV as a part of their participation. Both bi-variate and multi-variate analyses were conducted. About 0.5% of the total married couples in the current study included an HIV-infected partner; 0.11% were HIV concordant and 0.38% were HIV serodiscordant couples. Adjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated that HIV infection in couples (seroconcordant or serodiscordant) was significantly more likely among those couples where the man was migrant but not mobile and those couples where the man was migrant as well as mobile, relative to those couples where the man was neither migrant nor mobile. Male migration increases the risk for HIV among married couples in India, largely in the form of serodiscordance in which men are HIV infected. These findings document the need for not only primary prevention efforts to reduce HIV acquisition among migrant male workers, particularly more mobile migrants, but also efforts are needed to reduce subsequent transmission to their wives. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",HIV; HIV sero concordance; HIV sero discordance; India; Married couples; Migration; Mobility,"Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, 40127 Bologna, Italy; Department of Physiology, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, 741235, India",English

"Kamble S.V., Dalbert C.",Belief in a just world and wellbeing in Indian schools,2012,International Journal of Psychology,"This study investigates the meaning of belief in just world (BJW) for students' subjective justice experiences with their parents and teachers and for students' subjective well-being. The hypotheses tested were that the more strongly students endorse BJW, the less the distress at school and depressive symptoms they experience. Two dimensions of BJW were assessed: personal BJW, reflecting the belief that events in one's own life are generally just, and general BJW, reflecting the belief that the world is basically a just place. The participants were 278 Indian students attending ten 10th grade classes at two private English-medium schools. The results showed that only the personal BJW, not the general BJW, was important in explaining justice experiences and wellbeing. The more the students endorsed the belief in personal just world, the more they felt treated justly by their teachers and their parents alike, and the less distress at school and depressive symptoms they experienced. In addition, teacher justice, but not parent justice, explained distress at school. Finally, the effect of personal BJW on depressive symptoms was partly mediated by both teacher and parent justice. This pattern of results persisted when class effects were controlled. Overall, this pattern of results emphasizes the importance of the individual and subjective experience of justice of the teacher behavior for adolescent wellbeing. Implications for further studies on BJW and wellbeing at school are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Belief in a just world; School; Wellbeing,"Machine Intelligence Unit, Center for Soft Computing Research, Indian Statistical Institute, 203, B.

Ghosh K.,A possible role and basis of visual pathway selection in brightness induction,2012,Seeing and Perceiving,"It is a well-known fact that the perceived brightness of any surface depends on the brightness of the surfaces that surround it. This phenomenon is termed as brightness induction. Isotropic arrays of multi-scale DoG (Difference of Gaussians) as well as cortical Oriented DoG (ODOG) and extensions thereof, like the Frequency-specific Locally Normalized ODOG (FLODOG) functions have been employed towards prediction of the direction of brightness induction in many brightness perception effects. But the neural basis of such spatial filters is seldom obvious. For instance, the visual information from retinal ganglion cells to such spatial filters, which have been generally speculated to appear at the early stage of cortical processing, are fed by at least three parallel channels viz. Parvocellular (P), Magnocellular (M) and Koniocellular (K) in the subcortical pathway, but the role of such pathways in brightness induction is generally not implicit. In this work, three different spatial filters based on an extended classical receptive field (ECRF) model of retinal ganglion cells, have been approximately related to the spatial contrast sensitivity functions of these three parallel channels. Based on our analysis involving different brightness perception effects, we propose that the M channel, with maximum conduction velocity, may have a special role for an initial sensorial perception. As a result, brightness assimilation may be the consequence of vision at a glance through the M pathway; contrast effect may be the consequence of a subsequent vision with scrutiny through the P channel; and the K pathway response may represent an intermediate situation resulting in ambiguity in brightness perception. The present work attempts to correlate this phenomenon of pathway selection with the complementary nature of these channels in terms of spatial frequency as well as contrast. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden .",Brightness perception; contrast; extra-classical receptive field; parallel channels; spatial frequency; visual pathway,"Department of Psychiatry, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Vazhudavur Road, Puducherry - 605009, India; Department of Radiology, JIPMER, Puducherry, India",English

Adaptogens are herbs that help in combating stress. Ayurvedic classical texts, animal studies and clinical studies describe Ashwagandha as a safe and effective adaptogen. Aims: The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-concentration full-spectrum extract of Ashwagandha roots in reducing stress and anxiety and in improving the general well-being of adults who were under stress. Settings and Design: Single center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Materials and Methods: A total of 64 subjects with a history of chronic stress were enrolled into the study after performing relevant clinical examinations and laboratory tests. These included a measurement of serum cortisol, and assessing their scores on standard stress-assessment questionnaires. They were randomized to either the placebo control group or the study drug treatment group, and were asked to take one capsule twice a day for a period of 60 days. In the study drug treatment group, each capsule contained 300 mg of high-concentration full-spectrum extract from the root of the Ashwagandha plant. During the treatment period (on Day 15, Day 30 and Day 45), a follow-up telephone call was made to all subjects to check for treatment compliance and to note any adverse reactions. Final safety and efficacy assessments were done on Day 60. Statistical Analysis: t-test, Mann-Whitney test. Results: The treatment group that was given the high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract exhibited a significant reduction (P<0.0001) in scores on all the stress-assessment scales on Day 60, relative to the placebo group. The serum cortisol levels were substantially reduced (P=0.0006) in the Ashwagandha group, relative to the placebo group. The adverse effects were mild in nature and were comparable in both the groups. No serious adverse events were reported.

This study attempts to examine the reasons for alcohol intake and the belief about addiction and their effect on the severity of addiction in people with a different ethnic background. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at a Psychiatric institute with a cross-sectional design. The study population included patients hailing from the Jharkhand state, twenty each, belonging to tribal and non-tribal communities. Patients fulfilling the ICD 10 diagnostic criteria of mental and behavioral disorders due to the alcohol dependence syndrome, with active dependence, were taken, excluding those having any comorbidity or complications. The subjects were assessed with specially designed Sociodemographic-Clinical Performa, modified version of Reasons for Substance Use scale, Addiction Belief scale, and the Alcohol Dependence scale. Statistical Analysis and Results: A significantly high number of tribals cited reasons associated with social enhancement and coping with distressing emotions rather than individual enhancement, as a reason for consuming alcohol. Addiction was severe in those consuming alcohol to cope with distressing emotions. Belief in the free-will model was noted to be stronger across the cultures, without any correlation with the reason for intake. This cross-sectional study design, which was based on patients, cannot be easily generalized to the community.

Dopamine transporter (DAT1) mediates the active re-uptake of DA from the synapse and is a principal regulator of dopaminergic neurotransmission. The gene for the human DAT1 displays several polymorphisms, including a 40-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) ranging from 3 to 16 copies in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene. To assess the role of this gene in alcoholism, we genotyped the VNTR of DAT1 gene in a sample of 206 subjects from the Kota population (111 alcohol dependence cases and 95 controls) and 142 subjects from Badaga population (81 alcohol dependence cases and 61 controls). Both populations inhabit a similar environmental zone, but have different ethnic histories. Phenotype was defined based on the DSM-IV criteria. Genotyping was performed using PCR and electrophoresis. The association of DAT1 with alcoholism was tested by using the Clump v1.9 program which uses the Monte Carlo method. In both Kota and Badaga populations, the allele A10 was the most frequent allele followed by allele A9. The genotypic distribution is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and control groups of Kota and Badaga populations. The DAT1 VNTR was significantly associated with alcoholism in Badaga population but not in Kota population. Our results suggest that the A9 allele of the DAT gene is involved in vulnerability to alcoholism, but that these associations are population specific.

It is important to address the various motives individuals may have for involvement in SSAU. Objective: To explore the motives associated with SSAU. Methods: Data were collected as part of the ongoing Prescription Drug Misuse, Abuse, and Dependence study in St. Louis. For this analysis, the sample included 173 participants who reported nonmedical sedative use for more than 5 days, and use of alcohol, in the past 12 months. SSAU was defined as past 12-month use of sedatives and alcohol together/at the same time. Results: Past 12-month SSAU was reported by 61 of the sample. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that for every increment of one motive, participants were significantly more likely to report SSAU (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.30; 95 confidence interval (CI): 1.121.52). Furthermore, reporting sedative use ""to get high, to change mood, to relieve stress, to party, and 'just because' "" was independently associated with the past 12-month SSAU. Past 12-month SSAU was also found to be significantly associated with simultaneous use of sedatives and cannabis in the past 12 months. Conclusion: A higher number of motives, as well as specific motives reported for sedative use, were found to be significantly associated with past 12-month SSAU. Scientific significance: Findings underscore the need for considering motives in tailoring preventive interventions for reducing SSAU.

Pirta R.S.,Mutuality of mind and body: Role of supernatural elements in human well-being,2012,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla Essentially the aim of applied psychology is to use the advances in the science of mind for understanding human mental processes and to modify human behavior and attitudes. In this attempt human brain and physiology are thought as mediating mechanisms and remain poorly understood by the students of applied psychology. In view of this indifference, the report of World Health Organization on mental health in 2001made a significant attempt by highlighting the advances in the brain sciences, on the one hand, and parallel developments in cognitive sciences, on the other hand. These advances additionally support the resolution of the World Health Organization to underline the mutuality of mind and body for understanding mental health. However, this most enlightening message of the report went unnoticed by the mental health professionals. The mutuality of mind and body has fundamental significance for applied psychology, in theory as well as practice. The issue is, does mind change brain (neuroplastic mechanism) and in turn behavior?

Several studies have been conducted to explore the antecedents of PWB. Present study is also a line of effort in this direction. The study was conducted to examine the role of traits (hope and Big five) in PWB among students of professional courses. The data was collected by using The Trait Hope Scale, Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) and Scales of Psychological Well-Being. The results show that hope was significantly positively associated with PWB. Neuroticism was significantly negatively associated with PWB whereas agreeableness was significantly positively associated with PWB.

Microglia are macrophage-like cells of the central nervous system which are activated by pro-inflammatory signals causing local production of specific interleukins and cytokines, and these in turn may further promote systemic metabolic disease. Whether or how this microglial activation can be averted or reversed is unknown. Since running exercise improves systemic metabolic health and has been found to promote neuronal survival as well as the recovery of brain functions after injury, we hypothesized that regular treadmill running may blunt the effect of western diet on hypothalamic inflammation. Using low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (ldlr-/-) mice to better reflect human lipid metabolism, we first confirmed that microglial activation in the hypothalamus is severely increased upon exposure to a high-fat, or ""western"", diet. Moderate, but regular, treadmill running exercise markedly decreased hypothalamic inflammation in these mice. Furthermore, the observed decline in microglial activation was associated with an improvement of glucose tolerance. Our findings support the hypothesis that hypothalamic inflammation can be reversed by exercise and suggest that interventions to avert or reverse neuronal damage may offer relevant potential in obesity treatment and prevention. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Exercise; Hypothalamus; Inflammation; Obesity; Treadmill,"Additional Professor, Dept of Clinical Psychology, NIMHANS, Bangalore 29, India; Clinical Psychologist, NIMHANS, Bangalore 29, India",English
"Mehrotra S., Tripathi R.",Affect intensity and negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies: A preliminary Indian study,2012,Asian Journal of Psychiatry,"Individuals differ in the intensity with which they typically experience affect as well as in their beliefs regarding their ability to alleviate negative mood states. These variables have been implicated in a range of clinical problems. Most studies utilize a single index of affect intensity. The differential correlates of positive and negative affect intensity, their association with negative mood regulation expectancy and their role as predictors of psychological outcomes have been insufficiently explored. This study aimed at exploring the relationship of affect intensity variables with negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancy, their association with age and gender and examining the role of affect intensity and NMR expectancy as predictors of stress and well being in a community sample of Indian adults. The sample consisted of 206 participants aged between 20 and 60 years. Higher age was associated with higher NMR expectancy but lower positive affect intensity. Positive and negative affect intensity showed differential patterns of association with NMR expectancy. Higher negative affect intensity was associated with lower NMR expectancy whereas higher positive affect intensity was associated with higher NMR expectancy. Affect intensity and NMR expectancy variables jointly predicted 30-39% of variance in perceived stress and well being.

Female sex workers with greater degree of mobility reported significantly more often than the FSWs with lesser degree of mobility that they experienced physical violence, and consumed alcohol prior to sex. Further, FSWs with greater degree of mobility reported significantly more often than the FSWs with lesser degree of mobility that they had inconsistent condom use in sex with clients, even after controlling for several demographic characteristics and socio-economic vulnerabilities including experiences of violence. Additionally, short duration visits and visit to the Jatra (religious fairs) places found to have significant association with their inconsistent condom use in sex with clients as well as continuation of sex despite having STI symptoms. These findings suggest the need for screening FSWs for higher degree of mobility and to mobilize them to form community networks so as to deal with violence, reduce alcohol use and promote consistent condom use along the routes of mobility. HIV prevention interventions aimed at FSWs require an increased attention to address the socio-economic vulnerabilities including alcohol use, with particular emphasis on those FSWs who are on the move in India and elsewhere. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Alcohol use; Condom use; FSWs; HIV; India; Mobility; Sex workers; STIs; Violence,"Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Deonar, Mumbai 400088, India",English

Existing studies on insula volume abnormalities report inconsistent findings potentially due to the evaluation of ′antipsychotic- treated′ schizophrenia patients as well as suboptimal methodology. Aim: To understand the role of insula in schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: In this first-time 3-T magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients (N=30) and age-, sex-, handedness- and education-matched healthy controls (N=28). Positive and negative symptoms were scored with good interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)>0.9) by using the scales for negative and positive symptoms. Gray matter volume of insula and its anterior/posterior subregions were measured by using a three-dimensional, interactive, semiautomated software based on the valid method with good interrater reliability (ICC>0.85). Intracranial volume was automatically measured by using the FreeSurfer software. Results: Patients had significantly deficient gray matter volumes of left (F=33.4; P<0.00001) and right (F=11.9; P=0.001) insula after controlling for the effects of age, sex, and intracranial volume. Patients with predominantly negative symptoms had a significantly deficient right posterior insula volume than those with predominantly positive symptoms (F=6.3; P=0.02). Asymmetry index analysis revealed anterior insular asymmetry to be significantly reversed (right>left) in male patients in comparison with male controls (left>right) (t=2.7; P=0.01). Conclusions: Robust insular volume deficits in antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia support intrinsic role for insula in pathogenesis of this disorder. The first-time demonstration of a relationship between right posterior insular deficit and negative symptoms is in tune with the background neurobiological literature.

The purpose of the present exploratory study was to examine beliefs about anger among a group of adolescent male offenders in India temporarily residing in a pre-sentencing institution. In particular, adolescent offenders (n = 14) were individually interviewed about their beliefs concerning causes and concomitants of, and behavioral responses to, one's own and others' anger, as well as family patterns of anger expression that are crucial in understanding socialization processes. Although some of the themes reflected in their narratives parallel the beliefs of educated, middle-class, non-offender youth in India (e. g., social inappropriateness of anger), as well as those of offenders in other parts of the world (e. g., aggressive behavior as a common response to anger), beliefs about various aspects of anger specific to this subculture of offender youth also emerged. In particular, perceived violations of family honor were cited as the most common elicitors of anger, and although anger was considered 'bad' it was expressed through aggression. The findings of this study highlight the need to develop a culturally informed theory of emotions, and relatedly, to develop culturally sensitive interventions for anger management that can be incorporated as a part of rehabilitation efforts for offender youth in India. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Adolescents; Aggression; Anger; Culture; Delinquency; Emotion; Qualitative research,"Unit for Nano Science and Technology, Department of Chemical, Biological and Macromolecular Sciences, S.

Particularly, the solvation of the microenvironments of the self assembly ultimately dictates the interaction with the drug molecules and their therapeutic efficacy. We present femtosecond-resolved studies of the dynamics of aqueous solvation within self-assembled dimeric structure of caffeine molecules. We have placed small hydrophobic probes 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2- methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl) 4H-pyran (DCM), coumarin 500 (C500) into the caffeine dimer to enable spectroscopic examinations of the interior. While molecular modeling and NMR studies of the probes in the caffeine dimers reveal a well-defined location (stacked in between two caffeine molecules), dynamical light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, densimetric and sonometric experiments explore the structural evolution of the dimer upon complexation with the probes. We have extended our studies in various temperatures in order to explore structural evolution of the self assembled structure and consequently the dynamics of solvation in the interior of the dimer. Picoseconds/ femtosecond resolved dynamics and the polarization gated spectroscopic studies unravel the hydration and energetics associated with activated viscous flow of the confined probes. Our studies indicate that the interior of the caffeine dimer is well-solvated; however, the dynamics of solvation is retarted significantly compared to that in bulk water, clearly revealing the dimers maintain some ordered water molecules. We have also explored the consequence of the retarded dynamics of solvation on the photo-induced electron transfer (ET) reaction of a model probe, 2-(ptoluidino) naphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) encapsulated in the dimer. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Activation energy for the viscous flow; Caffeine dimer interior .NMR spectroscopy of caffeine- TNS hetero association; Femtosecond-resolved hydration dynamics; TICT in caffeine dimer,"University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India",English

Ovariectomized (OVX) rats, replaced with estradiol to produce estrous-phase like conditions, showed a significant decrease in food intake as compared with that in OVX controls. Intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of CART (0.5-1 μg/rat) to OVX rats, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the food intake. The lower dose (0.25 μg) had no effect, and was considered subeffective. In estradiol replaced OVX rats, CART at subeffective dose, further reduced food intake. However, CART failed to reduce food intake in estradiol replaced OVX rats pretreated with anti-estrogenic agent tamoxifen (3. mg/kg, subcutaneous). Administration of CART antibody (1:500 dilution/rat, icv) significantly attenuated estradiol-induced anorexia in the OVX rats. While estradiol replacement significantly increased CART-immunoreactivity in the cells/fibers of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of OVX rats, fibers in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), and cells/fibers in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) showed considerable reduction. These changes were attenuated following concurrent injection of tamoxifen to the estradiol replaced OVX rats. However, CART-immunoreactive cells/fibers in the periventricular area did not respond to any of the treatments. We suggest that estradiol treatment might influence the hypothalamic CART system in a site specific manner. While increased CART activity in the PVN might produce anorexia, reduction of CART in ARC and AVPV might represent a compensatory homeostatic response. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",CART; Estradiol; Food intake; Immunocytochemistry; Ovariectomy; Tamoxifen,"Miami University, Department of Psychology, 90 N Patterson Avenue, Oxford, OH 45056, United States; H.

It is a part of another research investigation on resilience in which 200 adolescents (mean age=18.36) experiencing high academic adversity were chosen from a larger group of 566. This was done by selection of those adolescents who scored above Q3 on the Academic Adversity Scale, developed during the research work. In the present investigation, the resilience of these 200 adolescents was assessed through administration of the Mampane Resilience Scale. The sample was divided into high resilience (HR) and low resilience (LR) groups through a median split of the resilience scores. The academic performance of HR and LR groups as well as HR males and HR females was compared. Finally an attempt was made to find out if resilience scores could predict academic success; the criteria for success being selection to one's target institute for higher education. The results revealed that individuals reporting high resilience showed better academic performance as compared to those perceiving themselves to be low on resilience. Males scored higher on resilience and performed better in competitive examinations than females did. A major finding of this study was that the chances of HR adolescents being successful in competitive examinations was found to be 120% greater than that of LR adolescents. Future researches are required to understand better, the role of resilience in academic performance which in turn may help adolescents to navigate through important educational transitional points in their lives. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Academic achievement; Academic adversity; Adolescents; Resilience,"UGC-Academic Staff College, Pondicherry University, Puducherry-605 008, India; McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada",English

At present, the mental health needs of about 150 million Indian school childrenare grossly underserved. Although the Government of India is implementing several initiatives to ensure enrolment of children in schools, a similar drive to look after their mental health in school environments is urgently needed. A major concern that has emerged in recent years is the glaring lack of services for children's educational and psychological well-being. In this paper, we discuss basic issues related to the development of school psychology in India. The primary objectives of this paper are: (i) to explore Indian perspectives of educational settings, (ii) to examine the nature and scope of training for school psychology professionals, and their role and functions in school settings, and (iii) to charter the prospects of the International School Psychology Association and the Indian School Psychology Association in the development and promotion of school psychology in India. We first outline approaches to training and service provision used in several Western nations, and in particular, noting the role of professional organisations in developing guidelines for school psychology training and practice.

The HI group expressed less of positive emotions than the non-impaired counterparts. The two groups compared did not differ from one another with regard to expression of negative emotions and impulse strength. While both Positive Expressivity and Impulse Strength were significantly correlated with psychological well-being among HI adolescents, Impulse Strength alone was significantly correlated with psychological well-being among non-impaired adolescents. Psychological interventions for adolescents with HI may essentially address issues of emotional expressivity, especially positive emotions. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Emotional expressivity; Hearing impaired; Psychological distress; Psychological well-being,"M.D.University, Rohtak, India; Adarsh Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Bhiwani, India",English
"Malik A., Anand M., Karamvir, Batra A.","Effect of life skill training on academic anxiety, adjustment and self esteem levels in early adolescents",2012,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"The present research work has been designed to address the problems of academic anxiety, lack of adjustment and low self-esteem in early adolescents through a specially designed intervention and bring about a positive change in mental makeup and value system of students. The interventional processes include group meditation, breathing techniques, group discussions, outdoor activities and learning through fun and games. The pre and post study involved a sample of 252 students (mean age 14 years). Academic Anxiety Scale for children, Adjustment Inventory and Self-Esteem Inventory for students were administered. Findings reveal that there is a significant decrease in academic anxiety post intervention. Further, there is a significant improvement in selfesteem as well as adjustment level of the students. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",,"Department of Applied Psychology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata-700 009, India",English
"Sonthalia S., Dasgupta S.",Attachment styles and their implication for adolescents,2012,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"Adolescence is the age when an individual becomes integrated into the society of adults and a major transition starts taking place physically as well as psychologically. Therefore this stage is very sensitive and an important phase of life which shapes the entire future and it also predicts the quality of life an adolescent will lead. Attachment has become an important issue in clinical evaluation of, and legal decisions about, school-aged children. Bowlby's general framework of attachment formation in parent-child bonding posits that caregivers have predictable, common styles that impact a child's emotion regulation, social relatedness, capacity for self-reflection, and overall neurological development- factors that may extend through adulthood. So the aim of the study is to find out the association between the variables and how much it affects an adolescent behaviour and mental health. The sample consisted of 120 adolescent boys and girls' age ranging from 13-14 years and randomization technique was used to select them. Results were finally analyzed using product moment correlation. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Adolescence; Attachment style; Emotional regulation; Self reflection,"Psychology Research Unit, Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata-700 108, India; Psychology Research Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata-700 108, India",English
"Karmakar R., Ghosh A.",Altruistic behaviour of adolescents of different regions of India,2012,Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology,"The present study aims to find out the effect of some demographic variables such as age, gender, regional variation, father's and mother's educational background as well as socio-cultural variable such as parenting style on self reported altruistic behaviour of Indian adolescents of three different regions. 220 school going adolescents (boys and girls) participated in the study. The Self- Report Altruism Scale and Parental Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) were used in this study. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicates that authoritarian, authoritative parenting style as perceived by adolescents, and father's and mother's educational qualification are the most important predictors of adolescent's self reported altruistic behaviour. Findings of this study indicate that demographic variables as well as socio-cultural variable play important role in the development of altruistic behaviour. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.",Adolescents; Altruistic behaviour; Parenting style,"Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Chennai 600036, India",English
"Kumar K., Mishra A.K.",Quantification of ethanol in ethanol-petrol and biodiesel in biodiesel-diesel blends using fluorescence spectroscopy and multivariate methods,2012,Journal of Fluorescence,"Ethanol blended petrol and biodiesel blended diesel are being introduced in many countries to meet the increasing demand of hydrocarbon fuels. However, technological limitations of current vehicle engine do not allow ethanol and biodiesel percentages in the blended fuel to be increased beyond a certain level. As a result quantification of ethanol in blended petrol and biodiesel in blended diesel becomes an important issue. In this work, calibration models for the quantification of ethanol in the ethanolpetrol and biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel blends of a particular batch were made using the combination of synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) with principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square (PLS) and excitation emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) with N-way Partial least square (N-PLS) and unfolded-PLS. The PCR, PLS, N-PLS and unfolded-PLS calibration models were evaluated through measures like root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and square of the correlation coefficient (R 2). The prediction abilities of the models were tested using a testing set of ethanol-petrol and biodiesel-diesel blends of known ethanol and biodiesel concentrations, error in the predictions made by the models were found to be less than 2%. The obtained calibration models are highly robust and capable of estimating low as well as high concentrations of ethanol and biodiesel. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Biodiesel; Blend; Diesel; EEMF.

Banerjee P.,Relationship Between Perceived Psychological Stress and Depression: Testing Moderating Effect of Dispositional Optimism,2012,Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health,"The purpose of this study was to examine how the personality characteristic known as dispositional optimism influences the psychological stress-depression relationship. Dispositional optimism can have significant influence on individual stress-coping mechanisms. Earlier studies have not found consistent results regarding main effects of optimism on stress appraisal and depressive moods. Previous studies have mostly used students as participants that may have led to such inconsistent findings. In this study, employees working in a private Indian university were interviewed using a survey method. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that there was a mild moderating impact of dispositional optimism on the stress-depression relationship. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",depression; dispositional optimism; stress; turnover intention; well-being,"Anna University, CEG Campus, Chennai-600025, India",English
"Thiruchelvi A., Supriya M.V.",An investigation on the mediating role of coping strategies on locus of control - Wellbeing relationship,2012,Spanish Journal of Psychology,"The relationship among coping strategies, locus of control, and workplace wellbeing is examined. The model hypothesizes that coping strategies mediate the relationship between locus of control and work place well being. To test the model, data was collected from 154 software professionals using separate tools to assess coping strategies, locus of control and work place wellbeing. Model fit for the collected data was examined using structural equation modeling technique with the help of AMOS. Results support the view that coping strategies mediate the relationship between locus of control and work place wellbeing. While the path between locus of control and wellbeing is significant, the path between coping distraction and wellbeing is not significant. © 2012 by The Spanish Journal of Psychology.",Coping; Locus of control; Mediation; Structural equations modeling; Workplace wellbeing,"Henri Begleiter Neurodynamics Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Box 1203, 450 Clarkson Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11203, United States; Department of Clinical Psychology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Post Bag #2900, Hosur Road, Bangalore, Karnataka 560 029, India",English
